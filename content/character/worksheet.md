## Core Concept

- **Thesis:** "I am a ship's apothecary who follows supply chains like symptoms, but I won't buy truth with other people's lives."
- **Trouble:** "My life is complicated because I stole proof from a powerful distributor, and now the wrong people have reasons to find me."
- **Defining detail:** I nearly died in public from a contaminated tea, traced it to a corporate dosing scheme, and stole a ledger page that proves intent. Dock bosses either want to help me or bury me.

## 30-Second Summary

Meilin Starwell was raised dockside on the Rock of Bral, learning triage and hard practicality in her father Kaito's tiny apothecary. A tea stall incident nearly killed her, and she traced it to mindersand, a "drying powder" that can fog judgment and make people easier to steer. She followed the pattern through vendors and warehouse marks to Smith's Coster, stole a ledger page tying them to MS-13 mindersand and intent notes about "increasing compliance," and fled when pressure tightened around her father, patients, and witnesses. Now she's in Wildspace to keep the proof alive, stop the dosing chain, and avoid the leash disguised as "official work."

---

## Drives

- **Want (short-term):** Keep the crew functional and unpoisoned, and find the next link in the mindersand chain.
- **Need (growth):** Learn to trust others enough to share the burden instead of carrying it alone.
- **Fear:** Being domesticated by "help," a job offer, protection, or paperwork that turns into ownership.
- **Temptation:** Following the pattern past safety, pulling on a thread when she should rest or stay quiet.
- **Responsibility:** The people she left behind on Bral (her father, Sera, Meredin's network) are still within Smith's Coster's reach.

---

## Boundaries

- **Line I won't cross:** No patient or witness is leverage. No covert dosing.
- **Line I might cross if desperate:** Bribery, smuggling, forged paperwork, or quiet blackmail of the powerful. I'll bend rules to protect the vulnerable, but I won't spend the vulnerable.
- **What earns my trust:** Competence under pressure. Honest logs. Someone who takes notes. Someone who does the unpleasant task without drama.
- **What breaks my trust:** Messing with food or meds. Selling someone out to authorities. Taking my notes without consent. Pressuring me to sign "just a form."
- **What makes you angry instantly:** Anyone suggesting covert dosing, or treating a witness as a bargaining chip.
- **What melts your guard:** Competence under pressure. Honest logs. Someone who helps by taking notes or handling the unpleasant task without drama.

## Relationships

### Ally: Oona Marlow, Astral Bazaar stallkeeper and fixer

- **Met:** Meredin's network pointed me toward her stall when I needed work that didn't ask questions.
- **Bond:** She provides jobs, warnings, and pragmatic protection. I keep my boundaries clean and don't splash heat onto her neighbors.
- **I ask her for:** Work leads, port warnings, discreet supplies, and a place to breathe.
- **She asks me for:** Contamination checks, quiet triage for her contacts, and discretion about what I see.

### Ally: Meredin Sandyfoot, patron in the Burrows (Rock of Bral)

- **Met:** The people who needed discretion found me, and his name kept surfacing behind the introductions.
- **Bond:** He provides coverage for the Burrows' sick to reach capable hands without official questions. I provide follow-through and no sloppy messes.
- **I ask him for:** Warnings, routing, and gaps in the net when I need to move.
- **He asks me for:** Off-books treatment for his people, and discretion about what I see.

### Ally: Hask, tea vendor on the Rock of Bral

- **Met:** He served me the cup that nearly killed me. His hands shook when he realized what had happened.
- **Bond:** He came back two days later with a list of every stall he'd bought from, every warehouse mark. Guilt turned into something useful.
- **I ask him for:** Dock gossip, supplier lists, "what moved when."
- **He asks me for:** Forgiveness that doesn't feel like a lie, and protection from being made a scapegoat.

### Complicated Tie: Kaito Starwell, my father

- **The knot:** He's my anchor and my greatest vulnerability. If inspectors circle his shop, my choices get expensive fast.
- **He wants:** Me to be alive and free. To stop before the pattern swallows me.
- **I want:** Him to stay safe. To not become leverage.
- **Danger:** Smith's Coster knows where he is. Every move I make could land on his doorstep.

### Complicated Tie: Cassian Starwell, my brother

- **The knot:** He left Bral first to "see the stars," chasing helm-adjacent work. His letters stopped making sense, but I kept them anyway.
- **He wants:** To help, to open doors, to share opportunities he's found out in the void.
- **I want:** To trust him. To believe his offers don't come with strings I can't see.
- **Danger:** His "opportunities" often come with patrons, contracts, or favors attached. If he offers help, I treat it like a contract and read the fine print.

### Complicated Tie: Sera Quill, clerk and protected witness

- **The knot:** She came to me tired in the wrong way—tremors, metal taste, fog that didn't match sleep. She became the trail that led to Smith's Coster.
- **She wants:** Safety without being treated like an object. A way to help that doesn't turn her into leverage.
- **I want:** Her to stay invisible. To never become the price of my momentum.
- **Danger:** Smith's Coster is following her, mapping her movements. If they decide she's useful, my choices get expensive.

### Complicated Tie: Bram Cale, warehouse clerk who helped me steal the ledger page

- **The knot:** He was terrified and owned by the system, but he wanted out badly enough to help me get inside.
- **He wants:** An exit that doesn't look like betrayal until it's too late. Reassurance that he isn't already dead for helping me.
- **I want:** Him to stay quiet and stay safe. I can't promise either.
- **Danger:** He's compromised. He could flip, vanish, or be made an example. If he resurfaces, it's never good news.

### Antagonist: Smith's Coster (Corvin Hale, "quality concerns" contact)

- **They believe:** I'm a problem that can still be solved with the right offer or the right pressure.
- **They want:** My proof, my silence, or my signature on a contract that becomes a leash.
- **How they operate:** Clean offers first (resources, protection, "official work"), then administrative pressure (audits, paperwork, blacklists), then deniable escalation on people adjacent to me.

## Knives

- **The Ledger Page:** I have a ledger page tying Smith's Coster to MS-13 mindersand and "increase compliance" intent notes.
- **Violent Reaction:** Mindersand affects me far more violently than most people. I'm a walking early warning and a liability.
- **Pressure Points:** Any pressure on my father, Sera Quill, or Meredin's network forces me to choose between speed and safety.
- **Brother's Return:** My brother Cassian can re-enter my life through a port, a ship contract, or a patron, and his "opportunities" often come with strings.
- **Pattern Obsession:** I can't let go of a pattern. If something doesn't make sense, I'll keep pulling until I understand it, even when I should stop.

---

## Party Glue

- **Why I need this crew:** I can't watch my own back while I'm watching the cargo. I need people who won't sell me out when the pressure lands.
- **How I help the crew:** Contamination checks, triage, pattern-hunting, and the discipline to ask "what changed?" before anyone panics.
- **My berth on the ship:** Ship's apothecary, contamination checker, and the person who audits what "safe" really means.
- **A truth I'm afraid the crew will learn:** The ledger page exists. If they know I'm carrying proof, they become targets too.

---

## Secrets and Mysteries

- **Secret I'm keeping:** The ledger page exists and I'm carrying it. If the wrong people find out, everyone near me becomes leverage.
- **Why I hide it:** Sharing the full truth makes my crewmates targets. Smith's Coster doesn't need to hurt me; they just need to hurt someone I care about.
- **What happens if it's revealed:** Smith's Coster escalates. The crew has to decide if I'm worth the heat. My father and Sera become active targets instead of passive pressure.
- **Mystery even I don't understand:** Why does mindersand hit me so much harder than everyone else? There's something in my reaction that doesn't match the pattern.
- **The "last voyage" I won't talk about:** The night I left Bral, someone helped me disappear, and I don't know what they traded to make it happen.

## Backstory Summary

**Where I came from:** On the Rock of Bral, the docks don't sleep. Meilin was raised in her father Kaito's cramped apothecary corner, wedged between honest trades and dishonest money. He taught her to treat the docks like a diagnostician treats a body: listen first, then act. She learned triage the hard way—efficient compassion, steady hands, and questions sharp enough to cut through pride. Her brother Cassian left early to "see the stars," and she kept every letter he sent even when the details stopped making sense.

**The turning point:** A tea stall nearly killed her. One ordinary cup, one bitter taste that didn't belong, and her throat closed while the crowd watched. Her father saved her life and demanded specifics. Meilin found the trigger: mindersand, a pale "drying powder" that fogs judgment and makes people easier to steer. Her collapse wasn't malice—it was a system. Most bodies dulled quietly. Hers tried to die.

**Why I took to the void:** After tracing contaminated tonics to Smith's Coster and stealing a ledger page that proved intent, the city changed shape around her. Suppliers closed, prices tripled, dock-watchmen stared. Sera was followed. Patients came like shadows. If she stayed, the net would tighten until it landed on her father, her patients, everyone nearby enough to break her. So she took the only move that changed the battlefield: she left.

**The trouble that follows me:** Somewhere in a Smith's Coster ledger, there's a gap where a page used to be. They know who took it. Her father and Sera are still on Bral, still within reach. Every move she makes could land on their doorstep, and the next offer won't be polite.
