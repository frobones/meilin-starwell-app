**Skill Spotlight:** Medicine, Nature

Meilin shops like an apothecary and treats remedies as procedure. She knows her ingredients by use, not by romance. This is where her practical medicine philosophy takes shape: honest basics that keep a crew functional, consent before treatment, and a log that outlives fog.

The Astral Bazaar sells wonders in jars.

Meilin buys paper first.

She buys waxed sheets, clean corks, and a pen that will not bleed when the air is wrong. Only then does she buy ingredients. She does not trust the romance of “miracle cures,” not when she has watched a crew die from something labeled harmless.

Tonight she is working by lanternlight in a rented corner, a strip of counter that is not hers. Her satchel is tied down with too many knots, because theft is not a story here, it is a schedule. She lays out vials and balms like a procedure.

**Healing tonic** goes in the center.

Not because it is elegant, because it is honest. A simple tisane, brewed from fleshwort when she can get it, and substituted when she cannot. It is the first thing she offers after water, because it is the closest thing to a promise she will ever make in a crowded port. “Drink,” she says, and watches their hands. She watches whether they lie about pain.

Next is **healing salve**, witch hazel sharp in the air. She uses it for the moments when the crew can finally sit still long enough for rest to count. When people call it “wasting time,” she does not argue. She just points at the cut, the tremor, the breathing that is too fast, and says, “Time is what keeps you alive.”

On another tray she keeps her poison answers. She has two, and she prefers that it stay that way.

**Antitoxin** is the polite one. A simple purgatory, short-lived and practical, the kind of thing you take because you do not know what you touched. It buys breathing room. It buys clearer thinking. That is often enough.

**Antivenom** is the blunt one. She does not hand it out casually. It is for when the poison is already in, when a body is losing the argument. She uses it like a winch, hauling someone back to the surface and refusing to pretend it was easy.

She has one thing that looks like a joke until it saves someone.

**White willow** is bark mash, bitter and plain. She prefers it because it is the opposite of a miracle. It does not solve the problem. It makes the next minute survivable. It gives a crew member the nerve to stand up when they should stay down, and sometimes that is the difference between a retreat that works and a retreat that becomes a death.

Her “rare” picks are kept separate. Not locked away, just separated, like any instrument that should not be used by habit.

**Tahlia’s respite** is for exhaustion that will not listen to sleep. Meilin treats fatigue like a symptom, never like a moral failure. She will use this balm when she sees the hollow stare that comes before mistakes. She only uses it when there is time to do it properly, during rest, with consent, with notes. If someone jokes about “doping the crew,” her eyes go flat and her voice goes clinical. “This is treatment,” she says. “Not control.”

**Witch ward** is for curses, and for the kind of trouble that comes from touching old things in dead places. She does not like relying on it. She respects it anyway. When you are in Wildspace, you do not get to choose whether the hazard is mundane or magical. You only get to choose whether you treat it early.

She writes each preparation down.

Not poetry. Not a journal. A log.

Times. Ingredients. Who handled what. Who took what. Who improved and how fast. She does not do it because she likes paperwork. She does it because the people who use paperwork as a weapon depend on everyone else being too tired to keep records.

Meilin is not too tired.

Not yet.

When a crewmate steps into her lantern circle and says, quietly, “I do not feel right,” she does not ask for bravery. She does not ask for a story.

She asks for specifics.

Then she reaches for the honest remedies first, the ones that keep a crew functional, the ones that do not turn anyone into a price.
