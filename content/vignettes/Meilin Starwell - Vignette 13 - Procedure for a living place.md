Meilin sets up her counter space like an exam tray and reads fear and coercion instead of "insomnia." She treats the cause, not the performance, and pays for details that matter. Her apothecary method becomes Bazaar protocol.

---

Meilin doesn't arrive in the Astral Bazaar and become someone new.

She arrives and discovers her old self needs new rules.

On Bral, her methodology was for bodies.

In the Bazaar, her methodology becomes for everything that can hurt you, including paper, crowds, and kindness offered too cheaply.

The first night she rents a corner of counter space, she does it like she’s setting up an exam tray.

She wipes the surface twice.

Not because the Bazaar is dirty, because the Bazaar is loud, and clean surfaces reduce variables. She lays out her tools in an order that her hands can find without thought.

Bandage roll. Needle case. Waxed paper squares. Two vials with quiet stoppers. A small tin of salve. Chalk. A pen. A single folded cloth.

She adds one new instrument to the arrangement, and it feels strange to admit it belongs there.

Coin.

She puts the coin in its own dish. Not in her pocket. Not loose. Not mingled with her tools.

Money is contamination if you treat it casually.

She writes the date at the top of a page. Not a diary date. A log date.

Then she writes her first Bazaar rule in the margin.

If it matters, write it down.

The rule is older than the Bazaar. It was true in the clinic. It was true on the docks. It is truer here, where stories spread faster than truth and get paid better.

She is still looking down at the page when someone approaches.

A young woman, cheeks flushed, fingers shaking, hair tied with a strip of sailcloth. Her voice is steady, but her eyes are not.

"Do you have anything for sleep," she asks, too casually.

Meilin looks at her hands.

The woman’s nails are bitten short. There is a faint tremor in her ring finger. A small chemical burn scars the inside of her wrist, old and badly treated.

Not insomnia.

Fear.

Meilin asks, "What happened."

The woman laughs once, and it sounds like a door closing. "Nothing. I just, can’t get quiet."

Meilin nods. She doesn’t contradict. Contradiction makes people defend their lies. She doesn’t need a lie defended. She needs information.

"Who do you share air with," Meilin asks.

The woman’s gaze flicks to the crowd.

Meilin writes a single word on her page and does not show it to anyone.

Witness.

Meilin speaks softly. "I can help you sleep. But if someone did something to you, sleep isn’t the first problem. Safety is."

The woman’s throat moves. She swallows.

Meilin adds another Bazaar rule to the margin.

Treat the cause, not the performance.

She slides a cup of water across the counter. Plain. Honest. It buys time.

"Drink," she says. "Slow. Tell me if it burns."

The woman drinks. It doesn’t burn. That answer is a small anchor. Meilin takes it and builds the next question on it.

"Do you feel dizzy," she asks.

The woman hesitates, then nods.

Meilin’s mind shifts into triage the way it always does. She doesn’t feel dramatic about it. She feels procedural.

She asks the same questions she asked in the clinic, translated into this place’s hazards.

What did you eat. What did you drink. Who handed it to you. When did you start feeling wrong. Who benefits if you sleep through the next watch.

The woman answers in fragments. Meilin writes times. Meilin writes the stall location. Meilin writes the color of the cup.

The woman notices the pen moving and tries to pull back. "You don’t have to write it."

Meilin keeps writing anyway.

"I do," she says. "Not for you. For the second person."

The woman stares. "Second person."

Meilin nods once. "If this is a pattern, it will repeat. If it repeats, it becomes evidence."

The woman’s eyes water. Not from grief. From relief that someone is treating her problem like it matters.

Meilin hands her a small packet. Not a sleep draught. Something milder. Something that steadies a stomach and gives a body a chance to stop spiraling.

"This will help you breathe," Meilin says. "It won’t make you helpless."

The woman holds the packet like it’s dangerous. "What do I owe you."

Meilin glances at the coin dish. She thinks of her boundaries. She thinks of the way charity can become a hook in the Bazaar.

"A detail," she says.

The woman blinks. "A detail?"

"Name the person who gave you the cup," Meilin says. "Or describe their hands."

That sounds like a small thing. It is not a small thing.

The woman closes her eyes. She thinks, and then she speaks.

"Gold ring," she says. "Square cut. On the index finger. Callus on the thumb. Like he uses a stamp."

Meilin’s pen pauses.

Stamp.

Meilin feels the click of connection, the way she feels it when symptoms stop being random and start being a case.

She writes the description down. She adds a second note beside it, in smaller letters.

Compare to manifests.

When the woman leaves, Meilin does not watch her go.

She watches the crowd where the woman came from. She watches for a gold ring. She watches for a square cut. She watches for a callus.

She is not hunting.

She is observing, because observation is the first step before action, and action without observation is how people get hurt.

Later that night, Oona Marlow arrives with a bundle of rope and a face that looks like she has been smiling professionally for hours.

Oona sets the rope down and says, quietly, "You’re doing it again."

"Doing what?" Meilin asks, though she already knows.

Oona gestures at the counter. The clean layout. The coin dish. The notebook. The way Meilin’s hands return to the same place each time.

"Building a clinic," Oona says.

Meilin looks down at her tools.

"Not a clinic," she says. "A protocol."

Oona’s brows lift. "For what?"

Meilin doesn’t answer with romance.

"For a living place," she says. "For a port that wants to pretend it’s neutral."

Oona studies her for a long beat, then nods once, approving.

"Good," Oona says. "The Bazaar respects procedure."

Meilin’s mouth tightens. "No. The Bazaar exploits the absence of it."

Oona’s smile appears, small and real. "So keep doing what you do, Starwell."

Meilin turns a page in her notebook.

She writes a third Bazaar rule, as plain as a bandage.

Do no harm, and don’t let harm hide in the paperwork.
