The Astral Bazaar hums even when it is trying to sleep.

Canvas snaps softly. Brass chimes tick against each other. Somewhere nearby, a cook argues with a kettle like the kettle can be shamed into boiling faster. Meilin stands at the edge of a gear stall and watches hands.

Oona Marlow’s hands are the kind that remember every knot they have tied. There is a small burn on one thumb, old enough to have become part of the skin. Her stall is a neat mess, coils of rope, waxed canvas, sealed tins, a rack of tools that look harmless until you need one.

Oona does not waste time on greetings.

“You are Starwell,” she says, like it is a fact and not an introduction. “You know what goes wrong before it becomes expensive.”

Meilin doesn't correct her. She looks at the tins, the seals, the way the lids sit. She looks for residue where there shouldn't be any.

“I know what people pretend is harmless,” Meilin says.

Oona slides a small pouch across the counter. Coin. Light enough that it's not a bribe, heavy enough that it's not charity.

“I have a job,” Oona says. “Half a watch. Two deliveries. No questions.”

Meilin’s eyes move once, left to right, the stall, the crowd, the exits. Then back to Oona.

“One question,” she says. “Who gets hurt if it goes wrong.”

Oona’s mouth twitches. Not a smile, not quite.

“No one,” Oona says, quickly. Too quickly.

Meilin taps the pouch with one finger. She doesn't take it yet.

“Here is the first rule,” she says, and her voice goes flat with procedure. “No dosing. No slipping anything into food, water, or medicine, to calm people down, to test, to prove a point.”

Oona blinks, like she expected a price, and got a boundary.

Meilin continues. “No using witnesses as leverage. No turning some runner into a bargaining chip because the job is late and the port is loud.”

Oona’s gaze flicks to the crowd, then back. “You have had trouble,” she says.

“Everyone’s had trouble,” Meilin answers. “Mine’s recorded.”

Oona shifts the pouch again. “Fine,” she says. “No dosing. No hostage logic. You do your watch, you do your deliveries, and you walk away.”

Meilin finally takes the coin. She ties the pouch closed twice, because a single knot is optimism.

“If it matters,” she says, already scanning the stall’s stock, “write it down.”

Oona’s brows rise. “You write everything down?”

Meilin looks at the sealed tins again, and at the thin line where the lid meets the metal.

“Only the things that come back,” she says.
