# **Vignette 02 — Cant notes (how she picks up Thieves’ Cant)**

## At a glance

- Meilin starts hearing “the other language” under ordinary Bazaar chatter.
- She logs repeated phrases and chalk marks like symptoms, not like trophies.
- The meaning clicks when Oona uses small talk as warning and confirmation.
- Meilin answers the signal with procedure, she bars a door and reduces exits.
- She writes the translation down so it stays usable under stress.
- She keeps one ethics note attached: don’t use the language to spend innocents.

This vignette is **not** part of Meilin’s numbered backstory stages. It’s a small, optional “camera moment” about her learning to hear the Bazaar’s under-language without becoming the kind of person who worships it.

---

The Bazaar was loud in the way oceans were loud.

Not a single noise. An ecosystem of them.

Meilin learned quickly that if you listened only to the words, you missed the important part.

The important part was everything **around** the words.

The pause before a price. The way a vendor said “fresh” like a warning. The way a customer said “just looking” and still angled their body to block a line of sight.

And then there was the other language.

The one people used when they wanted to be understood by exactly the wrong number of witnesses.

Meilin first heard it outside a stall that sold “map cases” and “scroll tubes” and other innocuous containers that always seemed to be purchased by people with clean hands and dirty work.

Two men stood close enough to look like friends and far enough to look like strangers.

“Nice weather,” one of them said, smiling up at nothing.

The other nodded. “Wind’s turning.”

Meilin kept walking.

Her notebook stayed in her satchel.

But her mind did what it always did: translated symptoms into causes.

If they were really talking about weather, no one would bother to stand like that. No one would check the alley behind them before they spoke. No one would smile with their mouth and not their eyes.

They weren’t talking about wind.

They were talking about **risk**.

---

Meilin didn’t learn Thieves’ Cant from a mentor who gave her a speech.

She learned it the way she learned everything that mattered:

By watching it happen three times and refusing to pretend that was coincidence.

The second time she heard it, it came with a different surface story.

“Good stitching,” a woman said to a cloaked passerby, as if complimenting a hem.

The passerby didn’t stop. “Needs reinforcement,” they replied, calm as cloth.

The woman’s hand drifted to the edge of a crate, fingers brushing a chalk mark shaped like a crescent.

Meilin noticed because she always noticed chalk.

Chalk was procedure. Chalk was someone trying to make the invisible visible.

She waited until the woman left, then stepped in close and looked at the mark.

A crescent.

Beneath it, a tiny dot.

Not decoration.

A note.

Meilin didn’t know what it meant yet.

So she did the only honest thing:

She wrote it down.

Not in big letters. Not in a way that would make her feel clever.

Just a small entry, tabbed and indexed like a patient chart:

Crescent + dot (crate corner). Heard: "Good stitching." Reply: "Needs reinforcement."

---

The third time, the meaning arrived without permission.

It happened at the back of a gear stall where Meilin sometimes did quiet work. A runner came in with a basket and a face that looked too calm for the pace of their breathing.

Oona Marlow said, lightly, “You’re early.”

The runner answered, “Couldn’t sleep.”

Meilin caught it: Oona’s fingers tightened on the counter in the space between words. The runner’s eyes flicked to the door, then to the alley beyond it.

Not insomnia.

Pressure.

Oona nodded once and said, “Have you eaten?”

The runner’s voice stayed even. “Not since yesterday.”

Meilin’s stomach went cold.

She’d heard dockhands say “I haven’t eaten” to mean hunger.

This didn’t sound like hunger.

This sounded like **I haven’t been safe**.

Oona slid a small paper packet across the counter (something that looked like a cheap snack). Her hand lingered on it half a beat too long.

The runner took it without looking down.

Then Oona said, pleasantly, to no one in particular: “Weather’s turning.”

The runner replied, equally pleasant: “Wind’s turning.”

Meilin felt the click in her head.

Same phrase as the first time.

Oona glanced toward the alley and, without changing expression, shifted a crate a finger’s width to expose a chalk crescent and dot.

Then she looked at Meilin, just once.

Not asking.

Measuring.

Meilin didn’t speak.

She simply moved to the back door and barred it with a length of wood.

No drama. No questions. Just procedure.

If this was what she thought it was, the best way to “answer” was to reduce exits.

Footsteps came a minute later: two sets, then three. Voices outside, casual and too close. Someone knocked in the polite way people knocked when they wanted you to open the door so they could claim you let them in.

Meilin stayed still and listened.

Oona murmured, barely audible, “Hold steady.”

Meilin kept her hands off her crossbow.

Not because she was unarmed.

Because she understood, suddenly, that this language wasn’t about bravery.

It was about **coordination**.

About telling the right people the right thing while sounding like you were talking about soup.

The footsteps drifted away.

The pressure moved on to a softer target.

Oona exhaled.

Meilin wrote another line in her notebook:

**Weather’s turning / Wind’s turning = warning + confirmation.**

Then, after a beat, because she was Meilin and ethics were a kind of spine:

**Do not use on innocents. Do not sell names.**

---

Later, when someone tried to test her, and a stranger asked too casually where she slept and who she worked for, Meilin answered in the Bazaar’s dialect without giving them anything real.

“Busy season,” she said mildly.

And when the stranger pressed, smiling, Meilin added, “Wind’s turning.”

The stranger’s smile tightened.

Not because they understood the *words*.

Because they understood what the words meant:

**I am not alone. I am not lost. Choose another mark.**

Meilin didn’t enjoy that.

She didn’t collect it like a trophy.

She treated it like every other tool in her kit:

Useful. Dangerous. Logged.
