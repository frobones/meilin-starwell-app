**Skill Spotlight:** Thieves' Tools

Theo teaches Meilin that speed is a symptom, not a virtue. She practices locks like she practices medicine: documenting errors, slowing down under stress, and treating calm hands as the first survival skill.

Theo Lockwell's stall smells like oil and patience.

There are small parts laid out on cloth, lined up as if the cloth itself is a ledger. Picks. Tension tools. Tiny shims that look like nothing until a door refuses you. Theo looks up when Meilin arrives, and his eyes do the same inventory her hands always do.

“You are careful,” he says, by way of greeting.

“You sell tools that punish carelessness,” Meilin replies.

Theo makes a sound that could be a laugh, or could be a test passed. He slides a cheap practice lock across the counter. Not a toy, not a threat, just a fact.

“Show me your hands,” he says. “Not your confidence.”

Meilin sits. She doesn't perform. She sets her satchel strap around her wrist, twice, because the Bazaar steals when you blink. Then she takes out her own kit, worn and cleaned, and lays it down like an instrument tray.

Theo watches without speaking.

Meilin touches the lock, listens with her fingers. She tries pressure, not force. The first pin gives with a faint click, a sound so small it could be imagined. She doesn't celebrate it. She keeps going.

After a minute, Theo stops her with a raised hand.

“Too fast,” he says.

Meilin looks up. “It's open.”

Theo tilts his head. “And if you have to do it in the dark. In a hurry. With shaking hands. If someone is bleeding behind you.”

Meilin’s eyes go distant for half a beat, the way they do when she remembers the docks.

“Then speed is a symptom,” she says.

Theo’s mouth softens. “Good,” he says. “So. Quiet preparation.”

He shifts the lock, changes one thing, makes it a little meaner. “Do it again,” he says.

Meilin takes out her notebook. She writes the lock type. She writes what she felt. She writes where her pressure went wrong. She writes it like a medic writing a case note, because it is the same skill with a different patient.

Theo watches her write and nods once, approving.

“Most people come here,” he says, “because they want to feel clever.”

Meilin sets her pen down. “I come here because I don't want to feel surprised.”

Theo taps the notebook with one finger, careful not to smear ink. “That,” he says, “will keep you alive.”

Meilin picks up the tools again.

This time, she goes slower.
