**Skill Spotlight:** Deception, Undercommon

Meilin uses a plausible, controlled lie as leverage: not big, not dramatic, just enough to steer a decision. Speaking Undercommon signals she isn't a soft mark; she treats the language as a tool, not a trophy.

There is a kind of shop in the Astral Bazaar that never puts its name on a sign.

It sells "hinges." It sells "chalk." It sells "repair kits" in sealed tins that weigh too much for what they claim to be.

Meilin only comes when she has a reason, and she comes with her cloak hood up and her notebook hidden flat against her ribs.

Inside, the air smells like old metal and newer fear.

The clerk behind the counter is not Bralian. Not by accent. Not by posture. He watches her the way a lock watches a pick.

"Common," he says, without asking. "State your business."

Meilin answers in Undercommon.

Not fluent, not pretty, but correct enough to make his eyebrows lift and his attention sharpen.

"I need a bolt case that won’t rattle," she says. "And I need it to look like it should."

The clerk pauses, then replies in the same language, more smoothly than she can.

"That costs extra."

Meilin nods once, like she expected that outcome. She keeps her hands visible. Palms empty. No threat. No plea.

"I can pay," she says. "But I won’t pay twice."

The clerk smiles, thin and professional. "You think I cheat my customers."

Meilin gives him a small, calm look. "I think you charge for danger, and you hide danger inside the charge. It’s efficient."

His smile widens. He likes that. She didn’t call him a thief. She called him a tradesman.

He reaches under the counter and produces two bolt cases. Same leather. Same stitching. One is slightly stiffer, like it has an inner lining.

"This one is quiet," he says, tapping the stiffer case. "This one is normal."

Meilin doesn’t touch either one yet.

She leans in a fraction and lowers her voice, still in Undercommon.

"If you sell me the wrong one," she says, "I’ll find out later, and I’ll tell Oona Marlow that your quiet work isn’t quiet."

The clerk’s eyes flick, fast, to a corner of the room where a curtain hides a back door.

Not guilt.

Coordination.

Meilin continues, same tone, a medic explaining consequences.

"If you sell me the right one," she says, "I’ll tell her your prices are honest for what you are."

The clerk’s expression doesn’t change much, but his shoulders relax a hair. He believes she can reach Oona. He believes Oona matters.

Meilin didn’t say she knows Oona well.

She didn’t say Oona would care.

She simply offered a future that the clerk could measure.

That is the kind of lie that survives the Bazaar. Not big. Not dramatic. Just plausible enough to steer a decision.

The clerk slides the stiffer case forward.

"Quiet," he says.

Meilin finally picks it up.

She squeezes it lightly. Listens. Feels for hidden seams and cheap lining. The case is good. The stitching is even. The leather is treated.

"How much," she asks.

He names a number that is too high by a small, insulting margin.

Meilin doesn’t flinch. She also doesn’t accept it.

"No," she says, still in Undercommon. "That’s the price if I came in shaking. I didn’t."

The clerk’s lips part, then close. He studies her.

"What are you," he asks, and his voice is careful now.

Meilin considers telling the truth.

Apothecary. Log keeper. Someone who cares too much.

Instead she gives him a different truth, one that fits the room.

"I’m a crew problem," she says. "The kind that doesn’t go away if you ignore it."

The clerk laughs once, quiet and genuine. He lowers the price to something still painful, but fair for this place.

Meilin pays.

As she turns to leave, the clerk adds, almost casually, "You speak well for a surface girl."

Meilin pauses with her hand on the curtain.

She looks back and answers in Common, flat as a ledger entry.

"I listen better than I speak."

Then she goes out into the Bazaar’s noise, with a bolt case that won’t rattle, and a name that she didn’t give, and a small lie she can live with because it kept her crew safer.
