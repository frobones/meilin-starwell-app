Meilin learns early that the most dangerous weapons on Bral are often made of paper.

In the Astral Bazaar, paper gets sharper.

It starts with a rumor, passed the way people pass contraband, careful, casual, like they’re only talking to fill silence.

"Dockmaster’s office is looking for a manifest," someone says near a kettle stall.

"Which one," another asks.

"The one that proves a crew didn’t pay what they said they paid."

Meilin hears it and feels the familiar cold settle behind her ribs. Not fear. Pattern recognition.

Oona Marlow is already waiting when Meilin returns to the stall.

"Someone is shopping for old paperwork," Oona says.

Meilin nods. "And someone is threatening Vannis with a missing stamp."

Oona’s eyes narrow. "You saw him."

"I listened," Meilin replies. "Same result."

Oona pulls a folded sheet from beneath the counter, wrapped in oilcloth like it’s a blade. "This appeared in my drop box."

Meilin takes it with two fingers and lays it flat on the counter. She doesn’t open it yet. She studies the oilcloth first.

The wax seal is clean.

Too clean.

It looks like it was made with a stamp that was never used for anything else.

That’s not how a working port does it. Working ports are messy. They reuse things. They leave fingerprints. They leave nicks on their tools.

Meilin opens the oilcloth and finds a manifest page.

Not a full manifest, just a page, with a list of cargo and fees.

The page is meant to look mundane. That’s the trick. Mundane paperwork is the easiest place to hide a lie because nobody wants to stare at it long enough to be sure.

Meilin stares anyway.

She doesn’t start with the handwriting. Handwriting is a story, and stories are flexible.

She starts with the paper.

She runs a fingernail lightly along the edge. The paper is thick, but not the right kind of thick. It’s stiff in a way that says it was stored flat, protected. Dock paperwork lives in damp. It curls. It softens. It smells like rope.

This page smells like a drawer.

Meilin looks at the ink next.

The black is too black.

It hasn’t faded where the light would hit it. It hasn’t bled where a thumb would smear it. It’s a consistent, neat darkness, the kind you get from fresh ink and no stress.

Oona watches her, silent, patient.

Meilin points at the date line. "They chose an old date, but they used new materials."

Oona’s mouth tightens. "So it’s a forgery."

"Or a planted original," Meilin says. "Forgers like to pretend they’re archivists."

She moves to the stamp.

It is a circular mark at the bottom, meant to signal approval. The stamp impression is deep, crisp, and even.

Too even.

Meilin turns the page slightly and catches the light across the fibers.

An honest stamp is pressed by a hand that is tired, angry, rushed, or bored. The impression varies. One side bites harder. The paper dents unevenly.

This stamp is a perfect circle.

Meilin takes her notebook out and flips to a tabbed section. Cargo marks. Dock fees. Handwriting notes. Little observations that felt petty when she wrote them, and feel lifesaving now.

She compares the stamp size to a sketch she made weeks ago after watching a clerk stamp a duty receipt at the dockmaster’s window.

The diameter is off.

Barely. Enough.

Meilin exhales once, slow.

"They copied the symbol," she says. "Not the tool."

Oona leans closer. "Can you prove it."

Meilin nods. "Not in a courtroom. In a dockmaster’s office."

She points at the manifest’s cargo list.

"Look here," she says. "This line item, 'lamp oil, sealed tins.' It uses the wrong shorthand."

Oona frowns. "Shorthand is shorthand."

Meilin shakes her head. "Ports have habits. Clerks have habits. On Bral, lamp oil is written as 'L.O.' on official sheets, not 'OIL.' That’s how they distinguish it from alchemical oils that require inspection."

Oona looks at her, sharp now. "And whoever wrote this doesn’t know that."

"Or doesn’t care," Meilin says. "Carelessness is common. But it’s also traceable."

She circles the stamp and the ink line with the tip of her pen without touching the page.

"This is not dockmaster work," she says. "It’s someone pretending they understand the port, and betting that nobody else wants to do the boring part."

Oona’s voice stays low. "What do you want from me."

Meilin closes her notebook and looks up.

"A list," she says. "Every crew you know that had trouble with fees in the last month, and every factor who suddenly started asking after paperwork."

Oona’s eyes flick, considering cost, considering risk.

Meilin adds, quietly, "If they can ruin a clerk with a stamp, they can ruin a captain with a manifest."

That lands.

Oona nods once.

"I’ll get you names," she says.

Meilin slides the forged page back into the oilcloth and seals it with her own wax, a plain mark, not official, just hers.

Then she writes a line in her notebook, neat and clinical.

Material too new, stamp too perfect, ink too black.

Paper cuts deeper.
