**Skill Spotlight:** History

Meilin learns that "history" on Bral is practical institutional memory: who changed what rule after which scandal, and which windows hate each other. She uses precedent as leverage and teaches a clerk that procedure is history with good handwriting.

On Bral, the air near the docks always tastes like rope.

Not the rope itself, the memory of it. Salt in the fibers. Tar under the nails. Old sweat that never quite leaves the planks, even when someone scrubs hard enough to make a point.

Meilin likes the apothecary because it's quiet in a way the docks aren't. Quiet isn't safe, but quiet is readable. You can hear a breath catch. You can hear when someone says a sentence the way they say a lie.

The boy who comes in that afternoon isn't a sailor. Sailors bleed loudly.

He wears a clerk's cuffs and a dock badge that looks polished for someone who works in the mud of cargo. He holds his hand as if it's an object that might betray him if he lets it move.

"I don't need a lecture," he says, before Meilin's even washed her hands.

Meilin nods like she has agreed.

"Good," she says. "Sit."

He sits. He glances once toward the door. Not to see if anyone follows, but to see who might be listening. That tells her more than the badge does.

His hand is a small disaster, a cut across the palm that was cleaned badly and wrapped worse. The skin around it is angry. The cut itself is not deep, which means the panic is not about the wound.

Meilin unwraps the cloth. He flinches, then tries to hide it by clearing his throat.

"Cargo splinter," he says.

Meilin does not answer that. She holds his palm up to the light and looks at the angle of the cut.

"Quill splinter," she says instead.

His eyes flick to her face, quick and sharp.

Meilin keeps her voice even.

"A warehouse board doesn't cut like this," she says. "A desk does. Ink-stained wood, varnish cracked, the kind that catches skin when you're rushing."

He opens his mouth, then closes it. He watches her hands like she is a judge, and he hates that he needs her.

Meilin rinses the cut, slow and thorough. She picks out the sliver with tweezers. She does not make it dramatic.

When she speaks again, she does not ask what he did.

She asks what he is afraid of.

"Whose window," she says.

He swallows. Then he tries to laugh.

"What."

Meilin ties a clean wrap, snug enough to hold, loose enough that it won't swell him into pain.

"On Bral, there are windows that take coin," she says. "There are windows that take favors. There are windows that take blood. You don't polish your badge for the first kind."

His shoulders go tight, then soften, just a fraction. Like the truth is heavier than lying.

"Dockmaster's office," he says, then adds quickly, "Not the Dockmaster. One of the side windows."

Meilin nods. That narrows it.

On paper, the dockmaster's office is one building.

In practice, it's three windows with three seals.

There is the seal that moves cargo.

There is the seal that moves money.

There is the seal that makes problems disappear, and makes people disappear with them.

The clerk looks at the floor.

"They want me to sign," he says. "A fee adjustment. Just a correction, they said."

Meilin hears the phrase and feels the old memory settle into place like a key finding its groove.

Fee adjustment.

That was the wording they used years ago when a whole dock crew got blamed for a missing crate that was never missing. It was re-labeled, re-stamped, and "adjusted" into someone else's ledger.

Meilin was younger then. She was nobody. She'd stood in a line with other nobodies and watched a man in clean cuffs say it was procedure.

Procedure, she learned, is history with good handwriting.

Meilin finishes the bandage and rests the boy's wrapped hand on the table.

"Who told you to sign," she asks.

He hesitates.

Meilin does not fill the silence. She watches his mouth, the way it tightens on names like they have edges.

"Factor Hest," he says finally.

Meilin doesn't react. She keeps her face like a blank page.

But she remembers.

Factor Hest isn't new money, he's old leverage. He's the kind of man who survives changes in banners because he knows which debts don't get written down. He was a witness in the last dock scandal, and he didn't suffer for it. That means he didn't testify, he traded.

The clerk looks up at her.

"I thought you were just a healer," he says, like it's an accusation.

Meilin rinses her hands again. Water is honest. It doesn't pretend to be anything else.

"I am," she says. "But Bral teaches in waiting rooms."

She reaches for her notebook. It's not a grand ledger, it's a small one, the kind that fits under a sleeve. She flips to a page where she's written names, dates, and the kind of details people call gossip when they don't understand it's survival.

She taps a line with her finger.

"Three years ago," she says. "The dockmaster's office changed its fee schedule after the riot on Quay Nine."

The clerk blinks.

"That was about food," he says.

"It was about hunger," Meilin replies. "But it became about paperwork."

She looks at him, calm, exact.

"After that riot, they made a rule," she says. "No fee adjustment without a second witness seal, and the witness seal can't be from the same window that issued the form."

The clerk's eyes widen, then narrow with a kind of desperate hope.

"That's real," he says.

"It's written," Meilin says. "Written is what matters."

He leans forward, then stops himself, like leaning is dangerous.

"They told me it was an exception," he says.

Meilin nods as if this is normal, because on Bral it is.

"Exceptions are how they test whether you'll let them own your hand," she says.

The clerk's throat works.

"What do I do," he asks.

Meilin closes her notebook.

"You don't argue with the window that wants your signature," she says. "You go to the window that hates them."

He stares at her.

Meilin keeps her voice low.

"Ask for the second seal," she says. "Ask it in writing. Use the riot as your reason, not your fear. People on Bral respect precedent more than they respect pain."

The clerk swallows again. His shoulders are still tight, but his breathing's steadier. Like someone's moved the problem from his ribs to the table where it can be handled.

Meilin stands and opens a small drawer.

She takes out a scrap of paper, a plain receipt form, and writes two lines in careful ink.

She signs it with her own name, not as authority, but as a witness that he was here and his hand is injured.

If someone wants to say he signed under pressure, there will be a record that his hand was wrapped and his grip was compromised. That's not justice. It's leverage.

She slides the paper to him.

"You didn't hear this from me," she says.

He takes it with his good hand.

"I did," he says quietly.

Meilin tilts her head.

"Then forget the words," she says. "Remember the shape."

He looks at her, confused.

Meilin gestures toward the docks, toward the building that pretends to be one building.

"Power keeps minutes," she says. "It writes them down. It stamps them. It calls that history."

The clerk stands, careful with his hand now, and for the first time he looks like someone who might survive the day without being turned into a signature.

When he leaves, Meilin washes the table. She scrubs the ink stain where his wrist rested.

She does it slowly, because she's learned something Bral teaches without kindness.

Today becomes precedent faster than you'd think.
