# Meilin Starwell - Vignette 14 - The Case Ledger

## At a glance

- Meilin approaches the Medica like a patient, careful, skeptical, and ready to walk.
- Junia Rell is polite and precise, she makes help look like paperwork.
- Brother Sovo is practical and quiet, he cares about outcomes more than credit.
- The Case Ledger becomes a turning point, proof over rumor, procedure over panic.
- Meilin agrees to share, but refuses to sign away ownership or turn witnesses into a price.

---

The Astral Bazaar smells like hot oil, cold metal, and the thin sweetness of something pretending to be safe.

The Medica’s clinic does not look like a clinic.

It looks like a stall that learned how to hold a line.

Canvas screens. Clean water in a covered bucket. A lantern turned low so it does not call attention. A queue that tries to stand like it is not afraid.

Meilin stands outside it for three breaths.

She watches hands.

She watches who keeps their lids down, who keeps looking over their shoulder, who grips their own wrist like it is an anchor. She watches a vendor glance at the screened door and then walk past, too fast, like he has already been told not to look.

When she steps in, she does not lead with her name.

She leads with a jar.

It is small, sealed, waxed at the lip, wrapped in oilcloth that has never been used for anything else. Meilin sets it down on the counter and does not let go until the person behind the screen looks at her hands first.

That person is not wearing a badge.

She is wearing clean cuffs.

"Junia Rell," the woman says, like it is an introduction and a warning at the same time. Her voice is soft enough that it makes listening feel mandatory.

Junia does not reach for the jar.

She reaches for a notebook and a thin strip of paper with blank lines.

"Time," Junia says. Not a question, not yet.

Meilin answers anyway.

"Last night. Second watch. Thirty minutes after tea."

Junia writes without looking up.

"Source."

Meilin pauses, because this is always the place where people try to make the story into a person.

"A stall," she says. "A familiar stamp. A new dock."

Junia's pen stops. Just long enough to be noticeable to someone who reads pauses like symptoms.

"You are saying the stamp, not the stall," Junia says.

"I am saying the chain," Meilin replies.

Junia looks at her then. Really looks. Not at her face, at her posture, the quiet discipline of someone who has done triage in places where screaming wastes air.

"Good," Junia says. "We can work with chains."

The screen rustles. A man steps into the lantern circle carrying a folded cloth and a tin cup.

Brother Sovo smells like antiseptic and burnt tea leaves. He looks at the jar, then at Meilin, then away, like he is giving her space to stay in control of her own nerves.

"You brought a sealed sample," he says. "Thank you."

It is not praise. It is relief.

Junia pushes the strip of paper forward. At the top, in neat ink, it says CASE LEDGER INTAKE.

"Write the handling," Junia says. "Who touched it, when. Where it was stored. Who can swear to it."

Meilin takes the paper. Her pen does not shake.

She writes the handling.

She writes it the way her father taught her to write notes, plain, dated, and built for hostile eyes. She writes the part where she cleaned the jar with boiled water. She writes the part where she did not let anyone else carry it. She writes the part where she kept it away from her own kit, because contamination is not only poison, it is also carelessness.

Junia reads it once, then twice.

"We will copy this," Junia says. "We will seal the copy. We will keep a chain here."

Meilin nods. That is what she came for.

Junia adds, gently, like she is offering a blanket.

"We also keep originals."

Meilin's fingers tighten on the oilcloth.

Brother Sovo looks up sharply, then settles again. He watches Junia, not Meilin, like he is counting the seconds until this becomes a fight.

Junia smiles without showing teeth.

"It is safer," she says. "If you lose yours, the work continues. If someone takes yours, we still have evidence."

Meilin believes her.

That is the problem.

"Who decides who sees it," Meilin asks.

Junia does not pretend to misunderstand.

"The chapterhouse," she says. "The Case Ledger. We decide how to present it, when, and to whom."

Meilin thinks of Kaito's shop. Of a small room and a clean table. Of patients whose names were never meant to be leverage. Of a ledger that never left the drawer because paper can kill people when it is pointed wrong.

"I will give you a copy of my notes," Meilin says. "A copy of the proof too, sealed."

Junia's pen taps once against the table.

"We prefer originals," Junia says, and Meilin knows she means the proof, not the jar.

Meilin keeps her voice calm.

"I prefer that my witnesses stay alive."

The line between them is thin and clean. Not hostile, not friendly. A procedure line.

Brother Sovo sets the tin cup down and breaks it with a practical kindness.

"We can do a sealed deposit," he says. "A copy under your seal, a copy under ours. Stored separate. Access only with two hands present."

He looks at Meilin as he says it, making the meaning plain.

"You keep your original," he adds. "We keep a sealed copy, so the work survives you losing it."

Junia's eyes narrow a fraction. Then she nods, because Sovo has made it sound like policy, not compromise.

"Acceptable," Junia says, and the word lands like a stamp.

She reaches into a drawer and brings out a small block of wax and a plain seal.

Not fancy. Not official. Just consistent.

Meilin watches the seal press into the wax. She watches the impression form. A simple mark that means: we will remember this, even if it gets expensive.

Junia slides the agreement forward last. One page. Clean language. One line that matters.

ALL FINDINGS ARE PROPERTY OF THE CHAPTERHOUSE.

Meilin does not touch the page.

Junia waits. Patient, practiced.

Meilin looks at the screen door, at the queue beyond it, at the people who need help and have no room to argue about ownership.

Then she looks back.

"Cross it out," Meilin says.

Junia's smile turns more real, because now the terms are visible.

"We need standards," Junia replies. "Not freelancers."

"You need credibility," Meilin says. "Not collars."

Brother Sovo exhales through his nose, a quiet laugh with no joy in it.

Junia takes the pen.

She draws one line through the sentence. Neat. Final.

She writes a replacement beneath it.

FINDINGS ARE HELD IN TRUST BY THE CHAPTERHOUSE, ACCESS BY PROCEDURE.

Meilin reads it twice. Then she nods once.

Outside, the Bazaar keeps being the Bazaar. Coin clinks. A hawker calls. A laugh turns sharp and then stops.

Inside, Junia puts the sealed copy into a wooden box with three other sealed copies. A small pile of future arguments.

Brother Sovo touches the jar with two fingers, then brings them to his nose. He does not flinch, but his eyes go tired.

"Bitter-metal wrongness," he says quietly.

Meilin looks at the jar.

It is a small thing. It is not dramatic. It is not a miracle.

It is enough to start a case.
