  "content": "The Astral Bazaar doesn't smell like Bral.\n\nThat's the first thing Meilin noticed when she arrived, and it's still the thing she notices most. No salt-rot in the planks. No tar under everything. The air here tastes like incense and ozone and the faint copper of a dozen species breathing in the same enclosed space.\n\nBut some things travel.\n\nThe man at Oona's stall wears Bral colors: the grey-green of a licensed trading house, cuffs embroidered with the three-seal mark of the dockmaster's office. He's not a sailor. He's the kind of man who makes sailors sign things.\n\nMeilin is restocking Oona's remedy shelf when he arrives. She keeps her hands busy, her eyes down, her ears open.\n\n\"Standard procedure,\" the man says, sliding a form across Oona's counter. \"Bral-registered goods require a compliance seal before resale in any Wildspace market. It's been policy since the Quay Nine reforms.\"\n\nOona's fingers don't touch the paper. She looks at it like it might bite.\n\n\"I've sold Bral goods here for three years,\" she says. \"No one's asked for a compliance seal.\"\n\nThe man smiles. It's the kind of smile that knows it's winning.\n\n\"New enforcement,\" he says. \"The Bazaar council has agreed to honor Bral trade protocols. You can pay the fee now, or I can flag your stall for inspection.\"\n\nMeilin keeps stocking the shelf. She doesn't look up. But she's listening to the shape of the words, not just the words themselves.\n\nQuay Nine reforms.\n\nShe remembers that phrase. She was young when it happened, a dock-born kid watching adults argue about hunger and blame. The riots weren't about food, not really. They were about who got to stamp the paperwork that decided who ate.\n\nAfter the riots, the dockmaster's office made a show of reform. New rules. New seals. New windows that were supposed to keep the old corruption from happening again.\n\nMeilin remembers what actually changed: the fees went up, and the people who paid them changed hands.\n\nShe sets down a jar of dried yarrow and walks to the counter.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" she says.\n\nThe man turns. His smile doesn't waver, but his eyes do, a flicker of annoyance at the interruption.\n\n\"I'm with a customer,\" he says.\n\nMeilin nods like she's agreeing.\n\n\"I know,\" she says. \"I just wanted to ask about the witness requirement.\"\n\nThe man's smile stiffens.\n\nMeilin keeps her voice casual, like she's asking about the weather.\n\n\"The Quay Nine reforms,\" she says. \"They required a second witness seal on any fee adjustment. The witness has to be from a different window than the one issuing the form.\"\n\nShe gestures at his paper.\n\n\"Your form only has one seal,\" she says. \"Unless the Bazaar council has a Bral-licensed witness window, this document isn't valid under the same reforms you're citing.\"\n\nThe man's jaw tightens.\n\nOona's fingers are still above the paper, but now they're steady.\n\nMeilin continues, her tone almost helpful.\n\n\"I grew up on Bral,\" she says. \"Dock-born. I remember when the reforms passed. I remember who pushed for the witness requirement, and I remember who tried to have it removed three times in the first year.\"\n\nShe lets that settle.\n\n\"Factor Hest was one of them,\" she says. \"He's still trading, last I heard. Still using the old wording on his forms.\"\n\nThe man's hand moves toward the paper, a reflex, as if he wants to take it back before she can read any more.\n\nMeilin doesn't stop him.\n\n\"If you want to cite Bral procedure,\" she says, \"you should know Bral history. Because the people who lived through it? We remember what the reforms actually said.\"\n\nThe man picks up his form. He folds it once, then twice, then tucks it into his coat like it was never on the counter.\n\n\"I'll verify the protocols,\" he says. \"There may have been an administrative error.\"\n\nHe leaves without looking back.\n\nOona exhales slowly.\n\n\"You know him?\" she asks.\n\nMeilin shakes her head.\n\n\"I know the trick,\" she says. \"Different face, same ink.\"\n\nOona looks at her, thoughtful.\n\n\"You remember all that? Reforms, witness seals, names?\"\n\nMeilin returns to the remedy shelf. She picks up the yarrow jar, sets it in its proper place.\n\n\"History isn't dates,\" she says. \"It's who changed what rule after which scandal, and which people never got held accountable.\"\n\nShe pauses.\n\n\"On Bral, that's survival,\" she says. \"Here, it's leverage.\"\n\nOona nods slowly.\n\n\"And the leverage travels,\" she says.\n\nMeilin doesn't answer that. She just keeps stocking the shelf, her hands steady, her mind already filing the encounter away.\n\nThe Bazaar doesn't smell like Bral.\n\nBut some things, she's learning, travel just fine."
