In the Astral Bazaar, problems are sold as stories first.

Meilin listens past the story and watches the body.

It happens at a spice stall where the air is sharp enough to make eyes water. A dock runner leans on the counter, trying to laugh through a cough. The cough is wet, and it keeps catching, like the throat is coated in something it cannot move.

“Bad batch,” the stallkeeper says, already reaching for a new tin. “Happens. You want a refund or a replacement?”

The runner shakes their head too fast. “No,” they say. “No, I just, I don't feel right.”

Meilin steps into the conversation like a medic stepping between a patient and a crowd.

“Names,” she says, gentle but firm. “And time.”

The stallkeeper frowns. “Who are you?”

Meilin doesn't answer the question. She sets a small notebook on the counter, opens it, and keeps her hand steady. The pages are waxed at the edges, because the Bazaar likes to dampen paper with accident.

“When did it start,” she asks the runner.

“Ten minutes,” the runner says, then coughs again, and the cough sounds the same as the last one.

Meilin nods once. “What did you eat or drink in the hour before that.”

The runner looks embarrassed, like being sick is a moral failure. “Tea,” they admit. “And I bought a tonic. One of the cheap ones.”

Meilin writes.

The stallkeeper’s annoyance sharpens. “This isn't your business.”

Meilin turns the tin so the stallkeeper cannot hide the bottom. She does it without force, like rotating a specimen under light.

“Lot mark,” she says. “Show me.”

The stallkeeper hesitates. Then, seeing the runner’s shaking hands, sets the tin down.

Meilin copies the stamp, the ink style, the small flaw in the circle where the press does not meet cleanly. She writes the stall’s location in the Bazaar, because “near the cookfires” is not good enough when the port shifts.

She does not accuse. She does not start a scene. She asks the stallkeeper to set the tin aside, sealed, untouched. She asks the runner to drink water and sit down where the air is cleaner.

“I can give you something for the throat,” she says. “But first I need one more thing.”

The runner squints at her notebook.

“Why are you writing it down,” they ask, hoarse.

Meilin’s eyes flick once to the stamp again, then back to the runner’s face.

“Because the second time isn't an accident,” she says. “And because people who profit from fog depend on you forgetting the first time.”

She closes the notebook and tucks it away, flat against her body, where it cannot be taken without being obvious.

“If it matters,” she says, and it's not a quip, it's a rule, “write it down.”
