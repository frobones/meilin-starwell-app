    "**Test disguised as errand**: Oona sends Meilin to close a small debt that's really a test.",
    "**Reading the setup**: Meilin reads the setup: a chair angle, a practiced smile, and hands that betray fear.",
    "**Finding the pause**: She asks the question underneath the excuse and watches for the pause before a lie.",
    "**Uncovering pressure**: Vannis admits a \"factor\" is pressuring him for old manifests and missing stamps.",
    "**Procedural response**: Meilin turns it into procedure: pay Oona now, name the factor, describe what he watched first.",
    "**First real clue**: The first real clue lands: he looked at the stamp box before he looked at Vannis."

  "content": "The Rock of Bral teaches you the price of obviousness.\n\nThe Astral Bazaar teaches you the price of being right in public.\n\nMeilin learns the difference on a quiet afternoon, on a dock where the light is gray and honest, and the gangplanks creak like they want to be heard.\n\nOona Marlow sends her to collect a small debt.\n\nNot the kind that gets you killed if you fail. The kind that gets you tested if you succeed.\n\nThe borrower is a crew clerk named Vannis, neat beard, neat ink, neat hands. His stall is a narrow wedge between a sail patcher and a lampwright. He smiles when Meilin approaches.\n\n\"You're early,\" he says.\n\n\"I'm on time,\" Meilin replies.\n\nVannis gestures to a chair that doesn't quite face the street. It's a subtle angle. You sit in it, and you stop seeing who's coming until they're already close.\n\nMeilin doesn't sit.\n\nVannis's smile holds. It's well-practiced. It's also a fraction too slow, arriving after he sees that she didn't take the chair. Meilin files that away with the same calm she uses when a patient says they're fine and their pupils say otherwise.\n\n\"Coin's been tight,\" Vannis says, before she's asked anything. \"You know how it is. A ship's in, a ship's out. The air eats your profit.\"\n\nMeilin nods once. Not agreement, not sympathy, just acknowledgement that words have happened.\n\nShe sets her notebook on his counter, open to a blank line, and places her pen beside it. She doesn't write yet.\n\n\"I'm not here to scold you,\" she says. \"I'm here to close a ledger.\"\n\nVannis's eyes flick to the notebook. Then, involuntarily, to the edge of his own sleeve, where a faint line of red-brown stains the cuff. Ink, if you glance. Dried blood, if you look twice.\n\nMeilin looks twice.\n\n\"Oona's patient,\" Vannis says, as if Oona's patience is a natural resource that replenishes with tides. \"I can pay next watch.\"\n\nMeilin finally writes one word.\n\nNext.\n\nNot because she believes him. Because she wants to see what the word does to his face.\n\nVannis's throat moves. He swallows. He's trying to keep his expression smooth, but there is a pause, too short to be a hesitation in speech, too long to be nothing.\n\nIt's the pause you get when someone does mental math and doesn't like the sum.\n\nMeilin leans her forearms lightly on the counter, the way she leans in when she wants to hear a symptom without forcing it.\n\n\"Why did you borrow,\" she asks, gentle in tone, clinical in intent.\n\nVannis laughs once. Not amused. Defensive. \"Same as everyone. Repairs. Fees. Taxes that aren't called taxes.\"\n\nMeilin nods again and changes the question without warning.\n\n\"Who did you borrow from before Oona.\"\n\nVannis blinks. \"I didn't.\"\n\nThat answer lands too fast.\n\nIf it were true, he would have reached for a story first. People do. People can't help it. Truth has seams. Lies try to be seamless.\n\nMeilin doesn't challenge him. She watches.\n\nVannis's right hand drifts toward the underside of the counter, where a drawer could be, or a knife, or nothing at all. His fingers stop halfway, as if he remembers that moving too much is a confession.\n\nMeilin's eyes do not follow his hand.\n\nShe watches his left.\n\nThe left hand is the one that betrays him. The left hand presses briefly against the ledger stack, not to steady it, but to feel for something hidden between pages.\n\nMeilin understands.\n\nSomeone is leaning on him. Not with coin. With paper.\n\nPaper is the cleanest kind of threat, because it keeps your hands dry.\n\n\"It's not Oona you're afraid of,\" Meilin says, quietly. \"It's someone who keeps receipts.\"\n\nVannis's smile breaks, just a hair. He recovers fast, but the break is enough. The pause is enough. The tell is enough.\n\n\"No one's threatening me,\" he says.\n\nMeilin writes a second word, smaller than the first.\n\nSure.\n\nVannis stares at it like it's an insult.\n\nMeilin keeps her voice even. \"If you pay Oona next watch, and you have already promised the same coin to someone else, you'll fail both. That's how people end up missing.\"\n\nShe watches him inhale, the kind of breath that comes before a confession or a strike.\n\nHe doesn't strike.\n\nHe confesses, sideways, like a man trying not to use a forbidden word.\n\n\"A factor came by,\" he says. \"Wanted shipping manifests. Old ones. From a run last month. I told him I'd… find them.\"\n\nMeilin's pen stops.\n\n\"Why do they want old manifests,\" she asks.\n\nVannis hesitates. The pause appears again, the same exact length. Same internal math.\n\nMeilin taps the notebook lightly, once, like a pulse check.\n\n\"Because you changed something,\" she says. \"Or someone changed something and made it your fault.\"\n\nVannis's shoulders drop a fraction. Not relief. Resignation.\n\n\"He said it was routine,\" Vannis murmurs. \"He said he just needed to compare handwriting.\"\n\nMeilin's eyes go colder. \"He wants a forgery to look real.\"\n\nVannis whispers, almost inaudible, \"He said if I didn't help, he'd show the dockmaster the missing stamp.\"\n\nMissing stamp.\n\nMeilin doesn't need to see it to know what it means. She's seen men ruined for less.\n\nShe closes her notebook.\n\nNot because she's finished, because she wants Vannis to feel the weight of the next words without the comfort of paper.\n\n\"Listen,\" she says. \"You're going to do two things. You're going to pay Oona today, even if it hurts. And you're going to tell me the factor's name, and what he looked at first when he walked in.\"\n\nVannis blinks. \"What he looked at first.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Meilin says. \"Hands, door, ledger, exits. People look first where their work lives.\"\n\nVannis stares, then thinks, then answers with a small shiver.\n\n\"He looked at my stamp box,\" he says. \"Before he looked at me.\"\n\nMeilin nods once.\n\nThat's the only confirmation she needs.\n\nNot because she's clever.\n\nBecause she pays attention to the pause that happens when a person is about to lie, and the place their eyes go when they're about to do harm."
