# First Bolt

## At a glance

- Meilin clocks a quiet theft unfolding at Oona Marlow’s stall before anyone makes noise.
- She uses “inventory talk” as cover, to warn Oona and freeze the thief’s timing.
- When the thief escalates and uses Oona as cover, Meilin draws and fires with control.
- She aims to stop the hand, not to make a corpse.
- She holds the lane until the threat breaks and leaves, then checks Oona like a patient.
- She writes down the pattern so it can’t happen the same way twice.

The Bazaar had a way of teaching you the difference between *danger* and *inconvenience*.

Danger moved quietly.

Meilin realized that when she noticed **Oona Marlow’s** hands first, not her face.

Oona was speaking to a customer, smiling politely, selling rope and lantern oil and a bundle of cheap chalk. Her smile never changed.

But her fingers were trembling in a small, rhythmic way that didn’t match the conversation.

Meilin’s eyes dropped to what the customer was doing.

Nothing dramatic. No knife out. No shout. No “give me your coin.”

Just a body positioned wrong.

Too close. Too patient. Too comfortable, like they’d already decided how this ended.

Meilin’s mind did what it always did: took a sample.

She cataloged the details fast, in the silent language of triage.

- Weight on the back foot: ready to step away.
- Shoulder angled toward the crowd: using noise as cover.
- One hand visible on the counter.
- The other… not visible enough.

Meilin shifted half a step so Oona could see her clearly in the corner of their eye.

Not a rescue. Not a scene.

A signal: **I see it too.**

Oona’s breath changed (tiny, grateful, controlled).

The customer’s hidden hand moved, quick and practiced, toward the cash pouch beneath the counter.

Meilin’s fingers touched the small crossbow at her hip.

It didn’t feel like a weapon.

It felt like admitting she lived in a different world now.

She didn’t draw it.

Not yet.

She did the first, safer thing: she spoke.

“That rope’s not treated,” Meilin said to Oona, as if discussing inventory. “The fibers will fray if it gets wet. You’ll lose it in a week.”

Oona blinked, caught, then recovered smoothly. “Ah. You’re right,” she said, and reached down (toward the pouch) like she was going to check stock.

The thief’s hand froze.

Meilin kept her voice calm, informational. “And the lantern oil’s cut. See the separation? You can smell it if you stop pretending you can’t.”

The thief’s eyes flicked to her face for the first time.

Not anger.

Calculation.

Meilin met the look the way her father met bullies in the clinic: without heat, without flinch, like she was taking a temperature.

The thief decided to escalate.

They didn’t pull steel.

They pulled Oona.

A fast yank from behind the counter, using a body as cover and leverage at once.

Oona made a small sound, involuntary, as her ribs hit wood.

Meilin’s world narrowed into procedure.

Distance. Line of fire. Risk to bystanders.

Her hand crossbow came up in one motion, compact and ugly and honest.

She didn’t aim for center mass.

She aimed for the hand.

The shot cracked (small, sharp), swallowed by the Bazaar’s noise as if the place had been waiting for it.

The bolt struck the thief’s wrist with a wet, mechanical certainty.

The thief screamed and let go.

They stumbled backward, clutching the wound, eyes wide with the shock of consequences in a place that sold them.

Meilin didn’t chase.

She didn’t gloat.

She kept the crossbow trained until the thief was gone into the crowd, limping, noisy, no longer quiet.

Only then did she lower the weapon.

Her hands were steady.

Her stomach wasn’t.

Oona stared at her like she’d just changed the weather. “You could’ve killed them.”

Meilin’s voice came out even, but it cost her something. “I didn’t.”

She stepped behind the stall and crouched. Oona’s breathing was fast, shallow, fear plus pain. Meilin put two fingers on their wrist, counted, and nodded once.

Alive. Not bleeding out. No punctured lung.

She looked at the counter’s underside and found the cash pouch’s strap half-cut.

Not random.

Tools.

Practice.

Meilin’s eyes went cold.

“They’ll be back,” Oona whispered.

Meilin didn’t answer immediately.

She retrieved a strip of cloth from her satchel, wrapped it around the pouch strap, and tied it in a way that would show tampering at a glance. Not unbreakable. Just *visible*.

Then she wrote a single line in her notebook with an ink-stained thumb holding the page flat:

**Pattern: wrist-hook pull → crowd cover → pouch strap cut.**

She capped the pen and said, quietly, “Not the same way.”

Oona swallowed. “What are you?”

Meilin hesitated. Not because she didn’t know.

Because saying it out loud made it real.

“Apothecary,” she said at last.

Then, after a beat, because it was also true:

“And I don’t like people who use bodies as cover.”
