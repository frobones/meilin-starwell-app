**Skill Spotlight:** Sleight of Hand

Meilin treats sleight of hand like a tourniquet: not for show, for control. She pickpockets a pickpocket to restore stolen goods without making a scene. Calm, boring, and timed to someone else's impatience.

Meilin doesn't like stealing.

She likes sleight of hand the way she likes a tourniquet. Not for show. For control. For the moment when a situation starts bleeding attention.

The Bazaar tests that boundary on a night when a merchant comes to her with a problem and too much pride left to protect.

It’s a stall owner named Jori, thin from long hours and stubborn habits, hands that never stop counting and never stop moving.

"I’m losing stock," Jori says, voice low, face set in the patient smile he sells to customers. "Not to bad bookkeeping. Not to honest mistakes."

He doesn’t look at her when he says it. He looks at his own display table, at the hooks of cheap trinkets and useful tools, at the little curated miracles that keep his rent paid.

"If I call it out," he says, "I’m the villain. If I’m wrong, I’m worse than a villain. I’m a stall that cries wolf."

Meilin watches the crowd instead of his face. The Astral Bazaar isn’t a room. It’s a current. It carries bodies, excuses, and hands that belong to people you’ll never see again.

She doesn’t lecture him about the Bazaar. The Bazaar doesn’t learn.

"Show me how it happens," she says.

They stand as if they’re strangers who happen to like the same merchandise. Close enough to share breath if needed, far enough to avoid becoming a story.

Jori’s stall is a practical one. Waxed thread. Rivets. Small charms that look like luck but mostly function as debt. Little packets of spice, because the richest customers like to pretend hunger is optional.

Meilin watches what people touch. She watches what they touch twice.

On the third wave of customers, she sees him.

Not dramatic. Not flashy. A young man with clean sleeves and soft shoes, moving like he belongs anywhere. He pauses at the stall, laughs at something a customer says, and lets the crowd do the work of concealment.

His fingers drift. They don’t grab. They settle.

He takes a small pouch of coin from under the stall lip, where Jori keeps it half hidden, half reachable. He takes it the way a nurse takes a tray, as if it was always meant to be in his hands.

Jori doesn’t see. He’s looking up at faces. He’s selling calm. He’s trying not to look like prey.

Meilin doesn’t move fast. Fast is a symptom.

She steps in like a customer with questions, because questions are a kind of wall.

"That wax," she says, lifting a small tin between two fingers. "Is it animal based or resin based? I need it to hold in cold air."

Jori turns toward her, relief disguised as annoyance. "Resin. Holds fine."

The pickpocket is already easing away, coin pouch nested inside his sleeve like a secret.

Meilin talks anyway. She asks for a second tin, and a third, and a packet of thread. She makes Jori lift lids and list prices. She makes him use both hands.

It’s not cruelty. It’s medicine. She’s taking his attention and applying pressure until the bleeding stops.

The pickpocket brushes past her shoulder on his way out, because that’s how he leaves. Contact. Confusion. A body between witnesses and truth.

Meilin lets him think he chose the path.

Her left hand rises, casual, as if to steady herself against a hanging display hook. Her fingers find fabric and seam and the weight of the pouch through cloth.

Sleight of hand is not fast. Fast is a symptom.

Sleight of hand is calm, and boring, and timed to someone else’s impatience.

The pickpocket’s sleeve is tailored for theft. There’s an inner fold meant to catch coin and keep it quiet. Meilin’s thumb slips into that fold, and her fingers slide the pouch free the way she’d slide a splinter from skin.

The pickpocket keeps walking. His body doesn’t react, because he expects success. He expects the world to be busy.

Meilin keeps her face neutral. Neutral is a tool. It makes people underestimate your intent.

She doesn’t chase him. Chasing turns private problems into public ones.

Instead, she finishes being a customer.

She sets coin on the counter, counted and clean, enough for what she asked for. She waits until Jori turns to wrap the goods. Then she leans in as if she’s inspecting the thread, and her left hand slips under the stall lip.

It’s the same place the thief used. The same blind spot.

Meilin slides the pouch back into its hiding place with a motion as ordinary as returning a tool to its hook. Not fast. Not guilty. Just exact.

Jori’s eyes flick down for a fraction of a second. He sees the pouch. He sees that it’s back. He doesn’t react, because reacting would make it real to everyone else.

Meilin straightens and accepts her wrapped purchases like nothing happened.

Only then does she look toward the flow of people and find the pickpocket again, already angling away, already searching for the next quiet target.

She steps into his path without blocking it, close enough that he has to notice, far enough that neither of them becomes a scene.

"You lost something," she says, as calmly as if she’s correcting a dosage.

His eyes harden. His hand moves, then stops. He checks himself without thinking, sleeve, belt, pocket.

Nothing.

He looks back at her, and he understands in one clean slice.

"Don’t run," Meilin says. "Running is loud."

He breathes through his nose. He’s doing the math. He’s deciding whether he can vanish faster than consequence can follow.

Meilin doesn’t threaten his body. She threatens his pattern.

"That stall," she says, glancing back without turning her head, "isn’t safe to work anymore. Not because he’ll shout. Because I will."

The pickpocket’s jaw tightens.

"Pick someone else," she says. "Or I start asking questions where you hate questions."

He holds her stare for a heartbeat longer, then peels away into the crowd with a face that tries to stay neutral and fails.

Jori keeps selling. He keeps smiling. The Bazaar keeps moving.

When the rush thins, Jori leans toward Meilin like he’s offering a discount.

"I didn’t see," he murmurs.

"You weren’t supposed to," Meilin says.

"Why help me."

Meilin looks past him, at the crowd, at the stalls, at the quiet economy of shame.

"Because theft is contagious," she says. "If you bleed coin long enough, you start cutting corners. Then you start doing things you hate because you can’t afford better."

Jori’s throat works. He nods once, like he’s swallowing a debt.

Meilin taps the counter lightly beside the wax tins, a doctor’s knock on a doorframe.

"Next time," she says, quieter, "tell someone sooner. Pride makes noise. Noise makes targets."
