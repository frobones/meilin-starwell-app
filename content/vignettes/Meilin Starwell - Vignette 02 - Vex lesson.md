# Vex Lesson

## At a glance

- Theo sets a target and refuses to call it training, he calls it repetition.
- Meilin drills the hand crossbow until the motion becomes procedure.
- Theo teaches her the real point: hit to steal a moment, then exploit the blink.
- She learns to wait for split attention and wrong footing, not for “fair.”
- Days later, a crowd incident gives her a live test of that lesson.
- She fires when the real actor commits, then cuts a runner free before the scene turns lethal.

**Skill Spotlight:** Weapon Mastery (Vex), Sneak Attack

Theo drills Meilin until the crossbow becomes procedure, not performance. She learns to strike when attention is split: exploit the flinch, hit when the target is already compromised. This is where Sneak Attack stops being a mechanic and becomes a philosophy.

Theo Lockwell didn’t call it training.

They called it **repetition**.

Meilin stood in a narrow alley behind their shop where the Bazaar’s noise turned into a constant hiss. Someone had painted a target circle on a board that used to be a crate lid. The paint was old enough to have given up on perfection.

Theo set a compact crossbow on the bench like it was a tool, not a statement.

“It’s not a duelist’s weapon,” they said. “It’s for people who don’t get second chances.”

Meilin didn’t argue. She checked the string. Checked the notch. Checked the bolt seating. Her fingers moved in the same pattern she used when laying out bandage, needle, tincture: everything in reach, everything where it belonged.

“You don’t shoot to be brave,” Theo continued. “You shoot to make the next moment easier.”

Meilin raised the weapon.

The first bolt went wide.

Theo didn’t laugh. He just nodded like he’d expected that outcome.

“Again,” they said.

Meilin breathed out, slow, and shot again.

This time the bolt struck the board with a blunt, satisfying thunk. Not center. Not perfect. But **true**.

Theo said, “Good. Now do it the way it matters.”

They stepped into Meilin’s peripheral vision (not blocking the shot, just *present*).

Meilin’s hands tightened.

“You see?” Theo said. “The Bazaar never gives you a clean lane. People move. They shout. Someone’s always in the way.”

Meilin didn’t lower the crossbow. She did what she did when a patient started panicking: narrowed her attention to the useful variables.

Angle. Risk. Breath.

Then she fired.

The bolt struck the board again.

Theo’s mouth twitched. “Now you’re learning.”

Meilin frowned. “That wasn’t different.”

Theo tapped the board with a knuckle. “It was. You didn’t chase precision. You chased **control**.”

They walked behind her and spoke close to her ear, not threatening, just teaching.

“When you land a hit, you steal a moment from them,” they said. “Pain makes people blink. Anger makes them look at the wrong thing. That blink is your opening.”

Meilin’s eyes flicked to the bolt sunk in the wood. A new kind of ledger entry.

Cause. Effect.

Theo slid another bolt into her reach. “Put the next one where it belongs.”

Meilin raised the crossbow again.

She didn’t aim with romance.

She aimed with math.

The bolt struck the board a handspan from the first. Close enough to prove intent. Close enough to say: **I can repeat this.**

Theo nodded once. “That’s the point. Not the first hit. The second.”

Meilin’s pulse steadied.

She could feel the shape of it now: hit, then exploit the flinch, the way a system showed you its weakness the moment you applied pressure.

She didn’t call it mastery.

She called it **practice until it becomes procedure**.

The Bazaar tested her lesson within days.

It wasn’t a dramatic fight. It was the kind of problem that grew from crowds: a vendor screaming, a customer claiming theft, a guard stepping in with the bored cruelty of someone who’d rather punish than understand.

The accused was a young runner (thin, scared, and too proud to beg). Their wrists were bound with cord tight enough to leave pale lines.

Meilin didn’t care about the shouting.

She cared about the hands.

She moved like she belonged there, because looking lost was the fastest way to become prey. The crowd tightened. The guard barked something about “order.”

Then someone in the back shifted.

Not toward the guard.

Toward the bound runner.

Meilin saw it the way she saw contamination: the wrong movement in the wrong place. A second actor. A follow-up. The real theft about to happen while everyone watched the loud part.

The runner flinched as the hidden figure closed in (half protection, half opportunism). Meilin couldn’t tell.

It didn’t matter yet.

Meilin’s hand crossbow came up under her cloak line, compact and unheroic.

She waited.

Not because she was afraid.

Because she was disciplined.

The guard was still yelling. The crowd was still staring. The hidden figure’s attention was split: on the runner’s pocket, on the guard’s distraction, on their own exit.

Meilin fired.

The bolt hit meat, not bone, high in the shoulder, a place that made a person drop what they were doing and turn toward the pain.

The figure staggered, surprised into honesty.

In that same heartbeat, the guard’s attention snapped away from the runner.

The crowd broke its shape.

Meilin didn’t take a victory lap.

She stepped in close, fast, and cut the runner’s cord with a blade that looked like an apothecary’s tool because it *was* an apothecary’s tool.

“Move,” she said quietly, not kind, not cruel, clinical.

The runner bolted into the crowd like they’d been waiting for permission to live.

Behind them, the wounded figure tried to stand their ground, eyes wild with rage.

Meilin didn’t give them a speech.

She simply re-aimed while their attention was still broken, while their stance was still wrong, while their mind was still catching up to pain.

And she understood, with the cold clarity of a diagnosis:

The hit wasn’t the trick.

The trick was choosing the moment when the target couldn’t afford to fully notice her.

That was how she survived the Bazaar.

Not by fighting fair.

By fighting **when the system was already distracted**.
