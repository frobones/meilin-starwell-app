**Skill Spotlight:** Perception, Stealth, Common Sign Language

Meilin walks a route unarmed to see the truth. She reads shifted stalls and sight lines, lets a pick commit before catching them, and uses sign language to warn a stallkeeper without making a scene. Stealth is choosing what people notice.

Meilin doesn't become quiet because she wants to be a ghost.

She becomes quiet because she doesn’t want to be a target.

On Bral, a person can vanish into a crowd if they move like they belong to the crowd. In the Astral Bazaar, the crowd moves like it’s alive, and it has teeth.

Oona Marlow gives her a simple task.

"Walk the route," Oona says. "Don’t carry anything. Don’t buy anything. Just walk it, and tell me where it breaks."

Meilin understands. A delivery route is only a route until someone learns it. Then it becomes an ambush schedule.

She leaves her crossbow at home.

Not because she’s trying to be brave. Because she’s trying to see the truth without the comfort of a weapon.

She ties her satchel strap around her wrist anyway, twice, out of habit.

She moves through the Bazaar with her hood up and her shoulders slightly rounded, like a tired clerk, like someone with no valuables and no dreams. She keeps her hands empty. She keeps her pace steady.

Perception, she discovers, is not about sharp eyes.

It is about not letting your mind decide too early that you are safe.

The first break in the route is small.

A stall that sells brass nails has shifted two paces to the left. The vendor smiles too wide, like he’s proud of the change.

Meilin logs it mentally.

Shifted stalls change sight lines. Shifted sight lines change who can see who.

She continues.

The second break is quieter.

Three boys, not more than thirteen, lean near a barrel of rope ends. They aren’t doing anything illegal. That’s the point. They are just standing, talking, laughing.

Meilin watches their hands.

One boy keeps his fingers tucked inside his sleeve. Another keeps scratching his neck, an itchy, nervous motion that repeats on a rhythm. The third never looks at her face, only at her belt and the pockets of passersby.

Pickpockets, maybe.

Or just kids learning how to be a problem.

Meilin doesn’t avoid them. Avoiding them is a signal.

She passes, steady.

As she passes, she hears a small sound behind her. Not footsteps. Not speech.

The whisper of cloth.

She doesn’t turn.

She shifts her weight and lets her cloak swing a little wider, like a tired person adjusting a garment. She uses the motion to change the angle of her body, to put her left shoulder closer to the wall and her right shoulder closer to the crowd.

Her right pocket is now harder to access.

Her left pocket is now a trap.

She keeps walking.

She feels it when it happens, the lightest brush of fingers, the kind that would go unnoticed if you hadn’t spent your life watching hands for symptoms.

Meilin lets the fingers enter the left pocket.

She doesn’t grab. She doesn’t flinch. She lets the thief commit.

Then she stops, abruptly, in front of a stall where a bell chimes when you turn toward it.

The bell rings.

The crowd’s attention flickers, briefly, toward sound.

Meilin turns her head slightly, as if considering a purchase. She raises her left hand slowly and closes her fingers around the wrist inside her pocket.

Not hard. Not cruel.

Just enough to say: I know.

Behind her, a boy inhales sharply. The one with his hand tucked inside his sleeve.

Meilin doesn’t turn to look at him. She speaks to the stallkeeper, like she’s asking about price, and she speaks in Common Sign Language at waist level, where her hands can move without making a show.

Two signs, simple.

Watch. Hands.

The stallkeeper’s eyes widen, then narrow. He nods once, barely visible, and adjusts the way he stands, shifting to block his own coin tin.

Meilin releases the wrist in her pocket.

The fingers vanish like smoke.

She keeps walking.

Stealth, she realizes, is not only about moving quietly.

It is about choosing what people notice, and what they don’t, and doing it without turning the moment into a story that can be repeated against you later.

At the final bend of the route, she finds the third break.

A mirror.

Not the decorative kind. A polished brass panel set at a corner, angled to show the alley behind you.

Meilin stops and looks at her own reflection, hooded and small. She looks past it, into what the mirror reveals.

Two figures stand in the alley, pretending to talk.

One of them looks at the mirror. Not at her.

They are using it too.

Meilin walks on, steady, and her skin goes cold with understanding.

This route has been watched long enough that the watchers have invested in better tools.

When she returns to Oona, she doesn’t give a dramatic warning. She gives a report.

"Three breaks," she says. "Stall shift at the brass nails, kids at the rope barrel, and a corner mirror that someone else is reading."

Oona’s eyes sharpen. "You sure about the mirror."

Meilin nods. "They looked at it to look at me."

Oona exhales once, slow. "That’s good work."

Meilin doesn’t smile.

"It’s not good," she says. "It’s early."
