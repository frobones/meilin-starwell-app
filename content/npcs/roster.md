# NPC Roster

Named characters from Meilin's backstory and current situation. Each entry includes their role, what they want, what she won't give them, and how they might re-enter the story.

## Kaito Starwell

- **Role**: Meilin’s father; dockside apothecary/diagnostician; meticulous record-keeper.
- **Vibe**: Calm, weather-plain delivery; principled; refuses leashes disguised as “help.”

  - Stay alive, stay free, and don’t let guilt steer her into a cage.

  - A promise that she’ll “let it go.”

  - A letter arrives that is too calm and too brief (“All is boring. I am being boring.”), which is Kaito’s coded warning that inspectors have started circling.

## Cassian Starwell

- **Role**: Meilin’s older brother; helm-chaser; long-haul wanderer who left Bral to “see the stars.”
- **Vibe**: Warm, restless, charming in the way that makes doors open; avoids hard questions by making the moment lighter.

  - Permission to treat guilt like a bargaining chip (“I left, so let me fix it by paying for it”).
- **Re-entry scenes** (pick one):
  - A letter arrives first: bright tone, light details, and one line that doesn’t match the rest. “Don’t ask after the helm.”
  - The party docks and Cassian is already there, grinning too wide, with a new ship’s mark on his coat and ink-stained fingers from someone else’s paperwork.

    - Fear as a performance.
    - Any acknowledgement that “this is just business.”
