# NPC Roster

This is a DM-facing roster of the named and recurring NPCs tied to Meilin's backstory.

## Kaito Starwell

- **Role**: Meilin's father; dockside apothecary/diagnostician; meticulous record-keeper.
- **Vibe**: Calm, weather-plain delivery; principled; refuses leashes disguised as "help."
- **Use in play**: Anchor and vulnerability back on Bral; potential hostage-point, ally, or source of records.
- **What Kaito wants from Meilin**:
  - Stay alive, stay free, and don't let guilt steer her into a cage.
  - Tell him *enough* to help him protect the shop (without exposing her sources).
- **What Meilin refuses to give Kaito**:
  - The full web of names and methods that would make him a target if taken.
  - A promise that she'll "let it go."
- **Re-entry scene**:
  - A letter arrives that is too calm and too brief ("All is boring. I am being boring."), which is Kaito's coded warning that inspectors have started circling.

## Cassian Starwell

- **Role**: Meilin's older brother; helm-chaser; long-haul wanderer who left Bral to "see the stars."
- **Vibe**: Warm, restless, charming in the way that makes doors open; avoids hard questions by making the moment lighter.
- **Use in play**: A recurring "future port" lever: unexpected reunion, complicated rescue, or a well-meant offer that smells like a leash.
- **What Cassian wants from Meilin**:
  - To see her safe and thriving (not just surviving) in a life he helped normalize by leaving first.
  - Discreet medical help for someone on his ship (or for himself) without creating paperwork heat.
  - A reality check when he's about to sign something "temporary" that isn't.
- **What Meilin refuses to give Cassian**:
  - Blind trust in the patrons, captains, and contracts Cassian calls "opportunity."
  - The full truth of her proof and any patient/witness involvement if it would make him a target (or a courier).
  - Permission to treat guilt like a bargaining chip ("I left, so let me fix it by paying for it").
- **Re-entry scenes** (pick one):
  - A letter arrives first: bright tone, light details, and one line that doesn't match the rest. "Don't ask after the helm."
  - The party docks and Cassian is already there, grinning too wide, with a new ship's mark on his coat and ink-stained fingers from someone else's paperwork.
  - Cassian shows up with a "favor" from a patron: supplies, introductions, safe passage, everything Meilin hates because it comes with invisible strings.

## Meredin Sandyfoot

- **Role**: Quiet patron and fixer in/around the Burrows; provides "coverage," not ownership.
- **Vibe**: Practical, unsentimental, ledger-brained; values reliability.
- **Use in play**: Can route off-books patients, hide people, redirect pressure, trade favors for necessities.
- **What Meredin wants from Meilin**:
  - Solutions that reduce heat on the Burrows (real outcomes, not speeches).
  - Follow-through: if Meilin takes a favor, she closes the loop.
- **What Meilin refuses to give Meredin**:
  - The right to spend bystanders as assets (patients, clerks, "small names").
  - A blank check on what "coverage" costs.
- **Re-entry scene**:
  - A runner finds the party in port with a simple line: "Meredin says you're needed. Quiet. Paid. Tonight."

## Sera Quill

- **Role**: Tidy clerk dosed by routine (tea/tonics); becomes an unintentional trail to the supply chain.
- **Vibe**: Controlled, anxious, competent; wants her name kept out of violence.
- **Use in play**: Protected witness; a contact for paperwork, schedules, and "respectable" information channels.
- **What Sera wants from Meilin**:
  - Safety without being treated like an object.
  - A way to help that doesn't turn her into leverage.
- **What Meilin refuses to give Sera**:
  - Any plan that makes Sera the "price" of momentum.
  - Permission to martyr herself out of guilt.
- **Re-entry scene**:
  - A sealed packet arrives with immaculate handwriting: a shipping schedule, a ledger index, and one line: "I didn't want to know this, but now I do."

## Oona Marlow

- **Role**: Astral Bazaar gear stallkeeper (rope, oil, chalk, cases); pays Meilin for quiet "watch work."
- **Vibe**: Tired-eyed, ledger-brained, risk-aware; speaks in harmless phrases that aren't harmless.
- **Use in play**: A port contact for supplies, gossip, and low-drama jobs; can translate Bazaar pressure into actionable "weather."
- **What Oona wants from Meilin**:
  - A calm pair of eyes at the stall when the Bazaar gets predatory.
  - Boundaries that keep violence from splashing onto their business.
- **What Meilin refuses to give Oona**:
  - Anything that turns witnesses into bargaining chips.
  - Performative "heroics" that make the stall a target.
- **Re-entry scene**:
  - A note arrives with a price list and one extra line: "Wind's turning again. Different faces. Same hands."

## Elowen Pryce

- **Role**: Smith's Coster field representative; delivers warnings and applies pressure in public spaces.
- **Vibe**: Patient, professional, speaks softly in crowds; makes surveillance feel like weather.
- **Use in play**: The company's persistent pursuit. Escalation without blades: offers, warnings, and consequences.
- **What Pryce wants from Meilin**:
  - The ledger page recovered or destroyed.
  - To be seen choosing the leash (a public lesson to others who might get curious).
  - Predictability: if Meilin won't submit, Pryce wants her contained.
- **What Meilin refuses to give Pryce**:
  - Fear as a performance.
  - Any acknowledgement that "this is just business."
  - Anything in writing that becomes a collar.
- **Re-entry scene**:
  - Pryce appears in a crowded customs line and speaks softly without looking at her: "You're making paperwork wake up again."

## Bram Cale

- **Role**: Inside contact who helps Meilin get into a Smith's Coster warehouse to steal the ledger page.
- **Vibe**: Terrified, owned by the system, desperate for an exit.
- **Use in play**: A compromised insider; could flip, vanish, or be "made an example."
- **What Bram wants from Meilin**:
  - An exit that doesn't look like betrayal until it's too late.
  - Reassurance that he isn't already dead for helping her.
- **What Meilin refuses to give Bram**:
  - False certainty. She won't promise "they can't touch you" if she can't back it.
  - A plan that makes him do more than one dangerous thing.
- **Re-entry scene**:
  - Bram appears in a different port under a different name, asking for help in a way that suggests he's being followed.
