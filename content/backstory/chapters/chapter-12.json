  "content": "The Astral Bazaar didn't feel like a place.\n\nIt felt like a **transaction** that had grown streets.\n\nThere were no tides, no salt wind, no familiar dock-rot in the planks, but Meilin recognized the rhythm instantly anyway: a crowd that moved like a current, stallkeepers calling prices like prayers, guards watching hands instead of faces. The same old truth translated into stranger geometry:\n\n**Where anything can be bought, everything becomes leverage.**\n\nMeilin arrived with her satchel tight to her ribs and her father's notebook pressed flat against her like a second sternum. The ledger page was still there, sealed between clean sheets, protected from sweat and panic and foolish heroics. She didn't know what she was going to do with it yet.\n\nBut she knew what she couldn't do.\n\nShe couldn't wave it around like a banner.\nShe couldn't hand it to the first \"authority\" that smiled.\nShe couldn't let it become a reason someone else got hurt.\n\nSo she did the thing she always did when the world got too wide:\n\nShe started with **procedure**.\n\n---\n\nThe first lesson came fast, as lessons did in places that marketed miracles.\n\nA child bumped her elbow (small, ordinary, accidental).\n\nMeilin's hand moved automatically: satchel strap checked, pouch strings felt, notebook counted by weight. Her fingers found the seam of her coin purse open by half an inch.\n\nNot an accident.\n\nShe looked up.\n\nThe child was already three steps away, head down, shoulders rounded into innocence. Behind them, a man with an empty smile watched Meilin like he was waiting to see whether she'd make noise.\n\nMeilin didn't shout.\n\nShe didn't chase.\n\nShe simply let her gaze go clinical and still.\n\nThen she did what the docks had taught her was always the first move against a system:\n\nShe watched the **pattern**.\n\nThe child drifted toward a stall with dangling trinkets and too-cheap rings. The man didn't follow directly. He angled to the side, using passersby as cover. A third person, a woman with a basket, stepped in close enough to block sightlines between Meilin and the child for two heartbeats.\n\nThree-piece work.\n\nEfficient.\n\nMeilin's mouth went dry with something that wasn't fear. It was recognition. The same skill she used to trace supply routes was now tracing a theft.\n\nShe stepped sideways, quietly, following the edges of the crowd instead of pushing through the middle. She kept her shoulders small, her cloak plain, her eyes down the way a person looked when they didn't want to be remembered.\n\nWhen she reached the trinket stall, she didn't grab the child.\n\nShe asked the vendor, calm as if she were choosing herbs, \"How much for the blue vial?\"\n\nThe child froze for half a beat, because she'd spoken without looking at them.\n\nMeilin slid two fingers onto the counter and tapped, twice, in the same rhythm her father used when counting pulses. Not a threat. A diagnosis.\n\n\"Your friend opened the wrong pouch,\" Meilin said softly, still to the vendor, as if it were nothing but quality control. \"I'd like it back.\"\n\nThe vendor's eyes flicked to the child, to the man, to Meilin's hands.\n\nThe vendor said, equally soft, \"You're new.\"\n\nMeilin's voice stayed flat. \"Yes.\"\n\nThe vendor's fingers moved, not toward a weapon, but toward a small brass bell under the counter. A silent question.\n\nMeilin answered it with the only currency she trusted.\n\n\"I don't want blood,\" she said. \"I want my things. And I want to be left alone.\"\n\nThe child's shoulders sagged. A small hand produced Meilin's coin purse and set it on the counter. Not all the way closed.\n\nMeilin didn't scold.\n\nShe tightened the drawstring herself.\n\nIt wasn't mercy.\n\nIt was a boundary, delivered without drama.\n\nThe man with the empty smile drifted away, already looking for softer targets.\n\nThe vendor watched Meilin for a long second, then said, almost conversationally, \"You didn't panic.\"\n\nMeilin's eyes stayed on the purse. \"Panic wastes time.\"\n\nThe vendor's mouth twitched. \"What do you do, then?\"\n\nMeilin looked at the blue vial again, as if weighing it.\n\n\"I keep people alive,\" she said.\n\nThe vendor nodded slowly, like that explained why Meilin's hands didn't shake.\n\nThen he added, \"In a place like this, that's still theft.\"\n\n---\n\nMeilin didn't find a crew on day one.\n\nShe found an **edge**.\n\nIn the Bazaar, edges were safer than centers. The center was spectacle, where rare items got displayed and rare people got noticed. The edges were work: crates to shift, inventories to check, waste to haul, messes to clean before they attracted the wrong kind of attention.\n\nMeilin took the kind of work that let her stay anonymous.\n\n\"Apothecary,\" she told anyone who asked.\n\nIt was true enough that it didn't feel like a lie.\n\nThe second lesson came the night she tried to sleep.\n\nThe lodging was cheap and clean in the way places got clean when they knew customers might not survive to complain. The lock on the door looked sturdy, which meant it was the kind of lock that got tested.\n\nMeilin checked it twice.\n\nThen she checked the window.\n\nThen she checked the floorboards.\n\nThen she stopped, because she could hear her father's voice in her skull:\n\n*If it matters, write it down.*\n\nShe wrote the room the way she wrote symptoms: exits, angles, weak points, what could be used as a wedge, what could be used as an alarm. She didn't have Thieves' Tools yet.\n\nSo she made **tools** out of what she did have.\n\nNot to break in.\n\nTo keep people out.\n\nBy morning, her door had been tested. The scratch marks were slight. The latch had been jostled with professional care.\n\nSomeone had tried and decided it wasn't worth the noise.\n\nThat was how Meilin earned her first real resource in the Bazaar:\n\nNot trust.\n\n**Respect.**\n\n---\n\nThe third lesson came as an offer.\n\nNot from a smiling patron.\n\nFrom a stallkeeper with tired eyes and a ledger of their own: **Oona Marlow**.\n\nThey sold mundane gear with the quiet competence of someone who'd watched magic fail and learned to love rope anyway. Their shelves were clean, their inventory tight. They didn't oversell.\n\nThey also had a problem: small thefts that weren't \"worth the guard's time\" and weren't violent enough to justify panic, just constant enough to bleed profit.\n\nOona Marlow watched Meilin count her coins, watched her write down a price without being asked, watched her check a seal on a jar before buying it.\n\nThen they said, \"You move like you've been hunted.\"\n\nMeilin didn't deny it. \"I have.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Oona said. \"Then you know what to look for.\"\n\nThey didn't ask Meilin to fight.\n\nThey asked her to watch.\n\nOne shift. One evening. Stand behind the stall like she belonged there. Note which hands drifted too close, which shoulders blocked sightlines, which smiles didn't reach eyes. Oona would pay in coin and in something more useful:\n\nA place to exist without questions.\n\nMeilin agreed, because it matched her rules.\n\nProcedure. Documentation. No patient is a bargaining chip.\n\nThat night, she didn't catch thieves by chasing them.\n\nShe caught them by **predicting** them.\n\nShe watched the same three-piece pattern as before: child, blocker, watcher. She did what she'd done on Bral with contaminated shipments:\n\nShe followed the *invisible line* back to its source.\n\nWhen the child reached for the wrong pouch, Meilin didn't grab a wrist.\n\nShe spoke a name instead.\n\nNot the child's. She didn't know it.\n\nThe watcher's.\n\nBecause she'd heard it earlier, whispered by someone who didn't realize Meilin wrote everything that mattered.\n\nThe watcher went still, the way a liar went still when the truth landed cleanly.\n\nMeilin met his eyes and said, quietly, \"Not here.\"\n\nHe weighed her in a single breath: whether she was loud, whether she was backed, whether she was worth the risk.\n\nHe decided she wasn't.\n\nHe vanished into the crowd.\n\nMeilin didn't feel victory.\n\nShe felt the Bazaar tilt a fraction in her favor, like a ship answering a small correction.\n\nOona paid her at the end of the shift and added one more thing:\n\nAn introduction.\n\nNot to a captain.\n\nTo a lockwright: **Theo Lockwell**.\n\n---\n\nTheo Lockwell's shop smelled like oil and filings and old secrets.\n\nThey didn't ask Meilin why she wanted Thieves' Tools.\n\nThey asked her whether she could keep her hands steady when it mattered.\n\nMeilin held out her fingers (ink stained, herb stained, burn-marked) and said, \"These are steady.\"\n\nTheo snorted, amused, and slid a slim roll of tools across the bench.\n\n\"Then learn the rule,\" they said. \"You don't force a lock. Forcing leaves stories.\"\n\nMeilin almost smiled, because it was the same philosophy she used with bodies:\n\nDon't tear. Don't panic. Don't improvise when you can be precise.\n\nShe learned the feel of pins and tension the way she learned the feel of fever (subtle differences that meant everything). She learned to listen to a mechanism with her fingertips. She learned what *quiet* actually was.\n\nNot silence.\n\nControl.\n\nAnd because she was Meilin, she didn't just learn how to open things.\n\nShe learned how to tell when something had been opened **already**.\n\nWhen a seal had been reseated.\n\nWhen a latch had been tested.\n\nWhen an \"accident\" was a handprint.\n\nHer Rogue skills didn't arrive as a new personality.\n\nThey arrived as the same mind, forced into a new environment.\n\nIn a place where the floor didn't have tides, the **systems** still did.\n\n---\n\nThe last lesson of her first week wasn't a lock.\n\nIt was a weapon.\n\nMeilin didn't want a blade that made her look like she'd come to fight.\n\nShe wanted something that let her stay behind the work while still being hard to corner.\n\nSomething that looked like equipment in a world that sold equipment by the ton.\n\nShe bought a hand crossbow and a case of bolts and learned to load it until her hands could do it without thought. Not because she wanted to kill.\n\nBecause she wanted to live long enough to decide what came next.\n\nAnd when she wrote that night (tabbing the page in her notebook with a scrap of cloth like it was a wound dressing), she didn't write a grand vow.\n\nShe wrote a simple protocol:\n\n- Keep the ledger page flat and protected.\n- Don't let anyone else become leverage.\n- Learn the Bazaar's patterns faster than it learns hers.\n\nMeilin didn't become a Rogue because she wanted to steal.\n\nShe became a Rogue because, in the Bazaar, **competence looked like stealth**. The truth she carried needed hands skilled enough to keep it from being taken."
