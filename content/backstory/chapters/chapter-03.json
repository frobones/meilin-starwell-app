  "content": "Meilin's apprenticeship didn't start with a ceremony. It started the first time her father, Kaito Starwell, ran out of hands.\n\nA sailor came in with a split scalp, caught on a jagged cleat when the line snapped, and the shop filled with the iron stink of blood and saltwater. Her father pressed a folded cloth into Meilin's palms without looking at her.\n\n\"Hold,\" he said.\n\nShe held.\n\nThe man flinched and tried to laugh it off, eyes bright with the kind of panic that wanted an audience. \"I'm fine…\"\n\n\"You're bleeding on my floor,\" her father replied, as mildly as if discussing weather. \"Don't sway.\"\n\nMeilin felt the pulse under the cloth. Felt how the rhythm sped when the man spoke, slowed when he swallowed. She stared at the cut and kept her hands steady anyway, because the only thing worse than fear was fear that made you sloppy.\n\nHer father stitched. He didn't talk while he did it. When he was done, he set the needle down and finally looked at her.\n\n\"You didn't move,\" he said.\n\nIt wasn't praise. It was a verdict.\n\nAfter that, she was simply… included. In everything. Like a tool that had proven it worked.\n\nHe taught her the way the docks taught people: through repetition and consequence.\n\nShe learned to grind herbs until the texture was right without needing to be told what \"right\" meant. She learned which powders clumped in sea air and which needed waxed paper. She learned to listen to a cough and picture the lungs behind it, wet and angry, long before her father said a word.\n\nAnd she learned the etiquette of triage (the part that had nothing to do with medicine and everything to do with survival).\n\nBecause on the Rock of Bral, the sick didn't arrive in neat, scheduled lines.\n\nThey arrived in waves.\n\nA bruised knuckle from a tavern dispute. A burn from lamp oil. A fever that came with whispers: *curse*, *bad luck*, *someone's displeasure*. A child brought in limp, too quiet, while a parent's voice did the frantic work their hands couldn't.\n\nMeilin learned to ask questions that sounded rude to polite people and sounded like kindness to everyone else.\n\n\"How long?\"\n\"What changed?\"\n\"Who else is sick?\"\n\"What did you take before this started?\"\n\"Show me your hands.\"\n\nHer father's rule was simple: **you can't treat what you refuse to look at.**\n\nBut he had other rules he never said out loud, the ones you only learned by watching.\n\nLike how he never let a uniform set the tone in his shop.\n\nOnce, a pair of dock-watchmen brought in a man who'd been cracked across the ribs. They didn't call him by name. They called him *cargo rat*. One of them joked about letting him sleep it off in a cell.\n\nMeilin watched her father examine the bruise. Watched his fingers press gently, mapping the pain like a chart.\n\n\"Breath hurts?\" her father asked.\n\nThe man nodded, biting down on something (shame, anger, fear, all tangled).\n\nHer father stood, wiped his hands, and looked at the watchmen. \"If you want him alive tomorrow,\" he said, \"you'll stop talking and you'll carry him carefully.\"\n\nThe taller watchman bristled. \"You telling me how to do my job?\"\n\n\"I'm telling you what your job costs if you do it badly,\" her father replied.\n\nThe room went very still.\n\nMeilin felt something hot in her chest: admiration, and a sharp edge of dread. Because she understood, in that moment, that courage wasn't a roar. It was a calm voice that refused to be moved.\n\nAfter the watchmen left with their patient (quiet, careful, suddenly sober), Meilin whispered, \"They'll remember that.\"\n\nHer father didn't look up from washing his hands. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"You don't care?\"\n\nHe rinsed, slow and thorough. \"I care. I just care about the patient more.\"\n\nThat was what apprenticeship did to her: it rearranged her priorities until they were dangerous.\n\nNot dramatic-dangerous. Worse. **Reliable-dangerous.**\n\nPeople began to seek *her* out, not just her father.\n\nA cook with fingers cracked from lye scrub came in \"just for something to take the sting off,\" and found Meilin already setting out salve without needing the story. A deckhand with a tremor tried to hide it, and Meilin asked about his tea before he could change the subject. A merchant's clerk arrived with a polite smile and a sealed packet. \"A gift,\" they said. Meilin didn't open it. She weighed it in her hand and felt the intention behind it like a bruise you could see coming.\n\nShe started noticing the patterns her father never had time to explain.\n\nHow certain illnesses clustered around certain berths.\nHow a rash \"going around\" always seemed to hit the same crews.\nHow a \"cheap tonic\" turned up in the hands of people who couldn't afford to be tired.\n\nShe began to understand the real meaning of her father's third lesson.\n\nCures were politics.\n\nNot because medicine was corrupt by nature, but because people with power wanted it to be *useful*.\n\nOne afternoon, a woman came in wearing a clean apron and an exhausted expression that didn't fit the cleanliness. She wasn't dockside. She had the posture of someone used to being indoors.\n\nHer cough was controlled. Too controlled.\n\nHer father listened, asked questions, and prescribed something modest (nothing flashy, nothing that would make anyone with money feel like they'd purchased magic).\n\nThe woman's gaze slid toward Meilin, then away. \"I can pay,\" she said quickly. \"Properly.\"\n\nHer father's reply was gentle. \"I'm sure you can.\"\n\nThe woman hesitated. \"The clinic in High City said they're… booked.\"\n\nMeilin caught it, the way her eyes avoided the truth. Not *booked*. Refusing. Redirecting. Quietly turning her away without admitting they'd done it.\n\nHer father didn't press her for the real reason. He simply said, \"Drink this. Rest. Come back if it worsens.\"\n\nWhen the woman left, Meilin asked, low, \"Why wouldn't they take her?\"\n\nHer father cleaned his tools. \"Because she came with the wrong name attached. Or no name attached at all.\"\n\nMeilin frowned. \"But she's sick.\"\n\nHer father's hands paused. He looked at her, really looked, the way he did when he was about to hand her something heavy.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"That's the point.\"\n\nThat night, Meilin wrote her own notes in a cheap little book she kept separate from her father's. Not symptoms this time. Not dosages.\n\nNames of clinics. Names of suppliers. The stamps on packages. The handwriting on labels. Small things.\n\nBecause if people insisted on making cures political, then she was going to learn the language of that politics.\n\nEven if it meant she'd start seeing enemies in the margins of a ledger.\n\nEven if it meant she'd become the kind of person who couldn't stop solving other people's problems.\n\nBy the time she realized that habit had teeth, it was already part of her.\n\nAnd her father (irritatingly, infuriatingly right) only ever said, \"Again,\" and handed her the next task."
