  "content": "It happened on a day that should have been ordinary.\n\nThe docks were loud with bargaining: voices stacked atop voices, laughter and shouting and the steady chorus of work. Someone was hawking skewers that smoked with pepper and fat. Someone else had a kettle of cheap tea going, the kind that tasted like burnt leaves and optimism. Meilin had errands in her arms: packets of dried herb wrapped in waxed paper, a fresh inkstone, a coil of twine.\n\nShe stopped at the tea stall because she was young enough to believe \"treat\" could mean something small.\n\nThe vendor recognized her. Everyone recognized her by then, the diagnostician's kid with the practical braid and the eyes that didn't miss much.\n\n\"On the house,\" he said, already pouring. \"Tell your father I'm still waiting on that salve for my hands.\"\n\nMeilin took the cup. It was warm through the cheap clay. The steam smelled harmless: tannin, spice, something floral meant to disguise how stale the leaves were.\n\nShe lifted it.\n\nThe first sip tasted fine.\n\nThe second sip tasted like the start of a question.\n\nA faint bitterness that didn't belong (too sharp, too clean). Her tongue registered it before her mind did, the way her father had trained her: *read the message, don't answer it.*\n\nMeilin lowered the cup and opened her mouth to ask what he'd added.\n\nShe never got the question out.\n\nHer throat tightened as if someone had cinched a cord behind her jaw. Air turned thick. The noise of the docks (so familiar it was usually a blanket) became distant, like she'd been shoved underwater.\n\nSomeone said her name.\n\nSomeone laughed, thinking it was a joke.\n\nMeilin set the cup down with careful hands, because panic was messy and she refused to be messy.\n\nHer vision pinched. Bright at the edges. Her skin prickled in a hot, crawling wave.\n\n*Allergic,* her mind supplied, clinical even as her body betrayed her. *Exposure route: ingestion. Onset: immediate. Severity: escalating.*\n\nHer knees hit the planks.\n\nThe crowd surged in the way crowds always did (half concerned, half hungry for spectacle). The vendor's face went pale, his mouth forming apologies she couldn't hear. Someone shouted for her father, Kaito.\n\nMeilin tried to breathe and couldn't. She clawed at her own throat and hated herself for it, hated the instinctive animal part that didn't care about dignity.\n\nHer father arrived like a knife entering a room.\n\nHe didn't run. He didn't shout. He moved with the calm speed of someone who had already counted the steps between disaster and response.\n\n\"Clear,\" he said, and the word carried a weight that made people obey without understanding why.\n\nHis hands were on her face, tilting her chin, checking her mouth, her tongue, her lips. The dockside world narrowed to his voice.\n\n\"Meilin. Look at me.\"\n\nShe tried. Her eyes watered. Her heartbeat hammered so hard it felt like a separate creature inside her.\n\n\"What did you drink?\" he asked.\n\nShe couldn't answer. No air.\n\nHe didn't curse. He didn't scold. He simply reached into his bag and produced a small vial, cracked it, and tipped a measured amount into her mouth. Bitter. Burning. Familiar. Something to buy time.\n\n\"Swallow,\" he ordered.\n\nShe did, barely.\n\nHe pressed two fingers to her pulse and spoke to the air around them like he was giving orders to a ship.\n\n\"You,\" he pointed at a stunned dockhand, \"get water. Clean. Now. You,\" another point, \"run to my shop and bring the kit under the counter. And you,\" he fixed the vendor with a stare so sharp it could have cut rope, \"tell me exactly what you put in that pot.\"\n\nThe vendor stammered. \"Just, just the mix. The usual. I swear, I…\"\n\nHer father leaned closer. \"Names,\" he said softly. \"Not 'usual.'\"\n\nMeilin drifted in and out of the next minutes. The world was her father's hands and the rough boards under her palm and the awful, humiliating truth that her own body could be turned against her by something as small as a pinch of spice.\n\nAt some point, air returned in a ragged rush that made her sob once. Once. Then she bit it back.\n\nWhen she could finally speak, her voice came out thin.\n\n\"It tasted wrong,\" she rasped.\n\nHer father's gaze flicked to the cup.\n\nThe vendor was shaking like he might break apart. \"I didn't mean it, Mei-mei. I didn't know. I didn't…\"\n\nThe crowd murmured. Some wanted to blame him because blaming was easier than admitting chance existed. Some wanted to defend him because the stall had fed them on bad days.\n\nMeilin sat up, still dizzy, and looked at the vendor's hands.\n\nThey were cracked and raw from lye and saltwater, like so many dock workers. He'd offered her tea the way people offered kindness when they didn't have anything else to give.\n\nHer father watched her, waiting, because this was also a lesson.\n\nMeilin swallowed against the lingering tightness in her throat, then did something that surprised even her.\n\nShe lifted her shaking hand and patted the vendor's wrist.\n\n\"It's fine,\" she said, loud enough for the crowd to hear. \"You didn't know.\"\n\nThe vendor's eyes filled. \"I swear I didn't…\"\n\n\"I know,\" Meilin repeated, firmer. She forced her breathing into steadier patterns. \"Bring me the ingredient list later. And… don't change your mix until we know what did it.\"\n\nHer father's expression didn't change, but something in his shoulders eased.\n\nThe crowd, robbed of its villain, dispersed. Disappointed. Relieved. Already forgetting.\n\nThe vendor didn't forget.\n\nNeither did Meilin.\n\nBecause forgiveness didn't erase the truth: she had nearly died in public, and the culprit wasn't malice.\n\nIt was *ignorance*.\n\nIt was *unknowns*.\n\nThat night, after the shop closed and the docks quieted into the creak of rigging and distant singing, Meilin sat at the workbench with a cup of water and a scrap of cloth wrapped around her wrist like a reminder.\n\nHer father had told her to rest.\n\nMeilin rested for exactly the amount of time it took to decide she couldn't.\n\nShe laid out tiny piles of likely culprits: dried flower dust, ground spice, cheap sweetener, a pinch of powdered root that came through the docks in burlap sacks that all smelled faintly of mold.\n\nShe didn't do it recklessly. That was the difference between fear and method.\n\nShe did it the way her father had taught her: small. Controlled. Measured. Observed.\n\nA speck on the tongue. Wait. Record. Another speck. Wait. Record.\n\nPain is data.\n\nFear is data.\n\nCuriosity outranks comfort.\n\nHours later, her hands were steady again, ink-stained, alive with the terrible satisfaction of *knowing more than she had known yesterday.*\n\nShe found the trigger.\n\nNot Hask's fault. Something that rode supplies the way rot rode damp wood: quiet, persistent, hard to see until it hurt you.\n\nA fine, pale dust dockfolk called **mindersand** when they were being honest and \"drying powder\" when they weren't. It clung to seams and wax paper and the insides of sacks. It tasted like nothing at first and then, if you knew how to listen, like that faint bitter-metal wrongness at the back of the tongue.\n\nMost bodies took it the way they took bad air: a little slower, a little foggier, a little easier to steer.\n\nHers tried to kill her for it.\n\nShe should have stopped there.\n\nBut \"should\" didn't matter much to Meilin Starwell.\n\nBecause now she understood something fundamental:\n\nOn the docks, poison didn't need a villain.\n\nIt only needed a system."
