# Astral Bazaar: A New Port Teaches Old Skills

## Key takeaways

- **What happens**: Meilin lands in the Astral Bazaar with the ledger page hidden and a rule: no patient is a bargaining chip.
- **What she learns**: Bazaar survival is pattern-reading: spot the team, secure the room, document vulnerabilities, control the narrative.
- **New contacts**: **Oona Marlow** hires her for quiet watch work and introduces **Theo Lockwell**, who sells her Thieves’ Tools and hard rules about “quiet.”
- **Rogue pivot**: She trains practical Rogue fundamentals (security, detection, tools, hand crossbow) without changing who she is, just adapting her method.

The Astral Bazaar didn’t feel like a place.

It felt like a **transaction** that had grown streets.

There were no tides, no salt wind, no familiar dock-rot in the planks, but Meilin recognized the rhythm instantly anyway: a crowd that moved like a current, stallkeepers calling prices like prayers, guards watching hands instead of faces. The same old truth translated into stranger geometry:

**Where anything can be bought, everything becomes leverage.**

Meilin arrived with her satchel tight to her ribs and her father’s notebook pressed flat against her like a second sternum. The ledger page was still there, sealed between clean sheets, protected from sweat and panic and foolish heroics. She didn’t know what she was going to do with it yet.

But she knew what she couldn’t do.

She couldn’t wave it around like a banner.
She couldn’t hand it to the first “authority” that smiled.
She couldn’t let it become a reason someone else got hurt.

So she did the thing she always did when the world got too wide:

She started with **procedure**.

---

The first lesson came fast, as lessons did in places that marketed miracles.

A child bumped her elbow (small, ordinary, accidental).

Meilin’s hand moved automatically: satchel strap checked, pouch strings felt, notebook counted by weight. Her fingers found the seam of her coin purse open by half an inch.

Not an accident.

She looked up.

The child was already three steps away, head down, shoulders rounded into innocence. Behind them, a man with an empty smile watched Meilin like he was waiting to see whether she’d make noise.

Meilin didn’t shout.

She didn’t chase.

She simply let her gaze go clinical and still.

Then she did what the docks had taught her was always the first move against a system:

She watched the **pattern**.

The child drifted toward a stall with dangling trinkets and too-cheap rings. The man didn’t follow directly. He angled to the side, using passersby as cover. A third person, a woman with a basket, stepped in close enough to block sightlines between Meilin and the child for two heartbeats.

Three-piece work.

Efficient.

Meilin’s mouth went dry with something that wasn’t fear. It was recognition. The same skill she used to trace supply routes was now tracing a theft.

She stepped sideways, quietly, following the edges of the crowd instead of pushing through the middle. She kept her shoulders small, her cloak plain, her eyes down the way a person looked when they didn’t want to be remembered.

When she reached the trinket stall, she didn’t grab the child.

She asked the vendor, calm as if she were choosing herbs, “How much for the blue vial?”

The child froze for half a beat, because she’d spoken without looking at them.

Meilin slid two fingers onto the counter and tapped, twice, in the same rhythm her father used when counting pulses. Not a threat. A diagnosis.

“Your friend opened the wrong pouch,” Meilin said softly, still to the vendor, as if it were nothing but quality control. “I’d like it back.”

The vendor’s eyes flicked to the child, to the man, to Meilin’s hands.

The vendor said, equally soft, “You’re new.”

Meilin’s voice stayed flat. “Yes.”

The vendor’s fingers moved, not toward a weapon, but toward a small brass bell under the counter. A silent question.

Meilin answered it with the only currency she trusted.

“I don’t want blood,” she said. “I want my things. And I want to be left alone.”

The child’s shoulders sagged. A small hand produced Meilin’s coin purse and set it on the counter. Not all the way closed.

Meilin didn’t scold.

She tightened the drawstring herself.

It wasn’t mercy.

It was a boundary, delivered without drama.

The man with the empty smile drifted away, already looking for softer targets.

The vendor watched Meilin for a long second, then said, almost conversationally, “You didn’t panic.”

Meilin’s eyes stayed on the purse. “Panic wastes time.”

The vendor’s mouth twitched. “What do you do, then?”

Meilin looked at the blue vial again, as if weighing it.

“I keep people alive,” she said.

The vendor nodded slowly, like that explained why Meilin’s hands didn’t shake.

Then he added, “In a place like this, that’s still theft.”

---

Meilin didn’t find a crew on day one.

She found an **edge**.

In the Bazaar, edges were safer than centers. The center was spectacle, where rare items got displayed and rare people got noticed. The edges were work: crates to shift, inventories to check, waste to haul, messes to clean before they attracted the wrong kind of attention.

Meilin took the kind of work that let her stay anonymous.

“Apothecary,” she told anyone who asked.

It was true enough that it didn’t feel like a lie.

The second lesson came the night she tried to sleep.

The lodging was cheap and clean in the way places got clean when they knew customers might not survive to complain. The lock on the door looked sturdy, which meant it was the kind of lock that got tested.

Meilin checked it twice.

Then she checked the window.

Then she checked the floorboards.

Then she stopped, because she could hear her father’s voice in her skull:

*If it matters, write it down.*

She wrote the room the way she wrote symptoms: exits, angles, weak points, what could be used as a wedge, what could be used as an alarm. She didn’t have Thieves’ Tools yet.

So she made **tools** out of what she did have.

Not to break in.

To keep people out.

By morning, her door had been tested. The scratch marks were slight. The latch had been jostled with professional care.

Someone had tried and decided it wasn’t worth the noise.

That was how Meilin earned her first real resource in the Bazaar:

Not trust.

**Respect.**

---

The third lesson came as an offer.

Not from a smiling patron.

From a stallkeeper with tired eyes and a ledger of their own: **Oona Marlow**.

They sold mundane gear with the quiet competence of someone who’d watched magic fail and learned to love rope anyway. Their shelves were clean, their inventory tight. They didn’t oversell.

They also had a problem: small thefts that weren’t “worth the guard’s time” and weren’t violent enough to justify panic, just constant enough to bleed profit.

Oona Marlow watched Meilin count her coins, watched her write down a price without being asked, watched her check a seal on a jar before buying it.

Then they said, “You move like you’ve been hunted.”

Meilin didn’t deny it. “I have.”

“Good,” Oona said. “Then you know what to look for.”

They didn’t ask Meilin to fight.

They asked her to watch.

One shift. One evening. Stand behind the stall like she belonged there. Note which hands drifted too close, which shoulders blocked sightlines, which smiles didn’t reach eyes. Oona would pay in coin and in something more useful:

A place to exist without questions.

Meilin agreed, because it matched her rules.

Procedure. Documentation. No patient is a bargaining chip.

That night, she didn’t catch thieves by chasing them.

She caught them by **predicting** them.

She watched the same three-piece pattern as before: child, blocker, watcher. She did what she’d done on Bral with contaminated shipments:

She followed the *invisible line* back to its source.

When the child reached for the wrong pouch, Meilin didn’t grab a wrist.

She spoke a name instead.

Not the child’s. She didn’t know it.

The watcher’s.

Because she’d heard it earlier, whispered by someone who didn’t realize Meilin wrote everything that mattered.

The watcher went still, the way a liar went still when the truth landed cleanly.

Meilin met his eyes and said, quietly, “Not here.”

He weighed her in a single breath: whether she was loud, whether she was backed, whether she was worth the risk.

He decided she wasn’t.

He vanished into the crowd.

Meilin didn’t feel victory.

She felt the Bazaar tilt a fraction in her favor, like a ship answering a small correction.

Oona paid her at the end of the shift and added one more thing:

An introduction.

Not to a captain.

To a lockwright: **Theo Lockwell**.

---

Theo Lockwell’s shop smelled like oil and filings and old secrets.

They didn’t ask Meilin why she wanted Thieves’ Tools.

They asked her whether she could keep her hands steady when it mattered.

Meilin held out her fingers (ink stained, herb stained, burn-marked) and said, “These are steady.”

Theo snorted, amused, and slid a slim roll of tools across the bench.

“Then learn the rule,” they said. “You don’t force a lock. Forcing leaves stories.”

Meilin almost smiled, because it was the same philosophy she used with bodies:

Don’t tear. Don’t panic. Don’t improvise when you can be precise.

She learned the feel of pins and tension the way she learned the feel of fever (subtle differences that meant everything). She learned to listen to a mechanism with her fingertips. She learned what *quiet* actually was.

Not silence.

Control.

And because she was Meilin, she didn’t just learn how to open things.

She learned how to tell when something had been opened **already**.

When a seal had been reseated.

When a latch had been tested.

When an “accident” was a handprint.

Her Rogue skills didn’t arrive as a new personality.

They arrived as the same mind, forced into a new environment.

In a place where the floor didn’t have tides, the **systems** still did.

---

The last lesson of her first week wasn’t a lock.

It was a weapon.

Meilin didn’t want a blade that made her look like she’d come to fight.

She wanted something that let her stay behind the work while still being hard to corner.

Something that looked like equipment in a world that sold equipment by the ton.

She bought a hand crossbow and a case of bolts and learned to load it until her hands could do it without thought. Not because she wanted to kill.

Because she wanted to live long enough to decide what came next.

And when she wrote that night (tabbing the page in her notebook with a scrap of cloth like it was a wound dressing), she didn’t write a grand vow.

She wrote a simple protocol:

- Keep the ledger page flat and protected.
- Don’t let anyone else become leverage.
- Learn the Bazaar’s patterns faster than it learns hers.

Meilin didn’t become a Rogue because she wanted to steal.

She became a Rogue because, in the Bazaar, **competence looked like stealth**. The truth she carried needed hands skilled enough to keep it from being taken.
