# Sera's Ordinary Illness Becomes a Supply-chain Map

## Key takeaways

- **What happens**: **Sera Quill** arrives with routine-shaped symptoms; Meilin identifies mindersand in a “fatigue tonic.”
- **What she learns**: Lot marks connect dockside tonics/tea to shipboard stores. This is scalable, not personal.
- **Principle set**: Sera is the first thread, not a target; Meilin refuses to weaponize her as leverage.
- **Ongoing hook**: The trail points toward a respectable distribution chain, and Meilin starts tracing it with paperwork-grade rigor.

Meilin had only just come back from her short contract aboard the *Drift-Sparrow* when the next problem walked in wearing a tidy coat and a careful face.

Sera Quill arrived like she’d been trying not to arrive.

She hovered at the threshold of Meilin’s shop for a full breath (hands folded neatly in front of her, hair pinned back with practical care, eyes tired in a way that didn’t match her posture). The kind of person who kept other people’s lives from falling apart by never letting her own show strain.

When she finally stepped in, she did it quietly, as if the floor might complain.

Meilin looked up from her workbench where she’d been relabeling jars (someone else’s sloppy handwriting corrected into something that *wouldn’t invite mistakes*). Her fingers were stained with ink and herb dust; her sleeves were rolled. She took one look at Sera’s face and didn’t bother with pleasantries.

“You’re not here for a scraped knuckle,” Meilin said.

Sera blinked, startled, then gave a small, embarrassed smile. “No.”

Meilin gestured to the stool. “Sit.”

Sera sat like she’d been trained not to take up space.

Meilin didn’t ask, *What’s wrong?* That question was too broad, too easy to lie around. She asked the questions that made truth harder to dodge.

“How long,” Meilin said, setting her pestle down, “have you been tired in a way sleep doesn’t fix?”

Sera’s fingers tightened together. “A while.”

“That’s not an answer.”

Sera hesitated. “Three… maybe four weeks.”

Meilin nodded as if she’d expected it. “Tremors?”

Sera’s expression flickered: surprise, then resignation. “Sometimes.”

“Metal taste?”

Sera swallowed. “Yes.”

Meilin’s eyes sharpened, brightening in that worrying way the few people close to her recognized: the look that meant she’d found a pattern.

Sera hurried on, as if to make it less important. “It’s probably nothing. I just… I can’t afford to be… off. I’m a clerk. If I start making mistakes…”

Meilin held up a hand, palm out. “I don’t care what you can afford. I care what’s happening.”

Sera’s cheeks colored faintly. “I’m sorry.”

“Don’t apologize for being sick,” Meilin said, already moving. She took Sera’s wrist gently and felt the pulse: a touch fast. Not panicked-fast. **Dosed-fast.** She watched Sera’s pupils in the lanternlight, the slight delay when she tracked movement, the almost-invisible tremble in the fingers when Sera tried to pretend they were still.

Meilin’s mind ticked through possibilities the way a navigator ticked through stars.

Not a dramatic curse. Not a fever. Not a clean, heroic illness with a name people liked.

Something small. Repeated. **Routine-shaped.**

Meilin released Sera’s wrist and leaned back, clinical calm in her voice. “Tell me what you eat and drink at work.”

Sera blinked. “What?”

“Tea. Water. Tonics. Anything you take because you think it’s harmless.”

Sera looked genuinely confused. “Tea is… tea.”

Meilin stared at her until Sera’s certainty turned into uncertainty.

Sera sighed, defeated by the force of Meilin’s attention. “Fine. Tea in the morning. Usually from the same stall. Sometimes a tonic when I’m… dragging. It’s from a little shop near the Burrows. Everyone uses it. It’s supposed to help with fatigue.”

“Everyone,” Meilin repeated, tasting the word like she didn’t like its texture.

Sera’s mouth tightened. “It’s not illegal.”

“I didn’t say it was,” Meilin replied. “I said it was **routine**.”

Sera’s hands hovered, then she reached into her satchel and pulled out a small bottle wrapped in cloth.

Even the cloth was neat.

She set it on the counter like she was afraid it might stain the room with attention.

Meilin didn’t touch it immediately. She watched Sera’s expression instead.

“Who told you to come here?” Meilin asked.

Sera hesitated. “No one.”

Meilin lifted an eyebrow.

Sera exhaled. “Meredin’s runner. Nori. They said… you’d be discreet.”

Meilin nodded once. Coverage. Of course. Meredin didn’t send crusaders. Meredin sent people who needed to survive.

Meilin finally unwrapped the bottle.

It was ordinary at first glance: dark glass, a clean label, tidy print. Respectable. The kind of thing designed to reassure.

Meilin turned it slowly in her fingers, reading it the way her father had taught her to read bodies.

Ingredients listed. Dosage suggestion. A “seal of quality” pressed into the paper.

And then, near the bottom, something most people never noticed.

A tiny sequence of marks, barely more than decoration unless you knew what to look for.

A lot mark.

Meilin’s thumb paused over it. Her breath went very still.

Because she’d seen that style of mark before.

Not on Bral’s clinic paperwork. Not on the polite shelves.

On ship stores.

On sacks.

On tins that tasted wrong.

Sera watched her face and went pale. “Is it bad?”

Meilin didn’t answer yet. She uncorked the bottle, sniffed once, then again.

Her expression didn’t change. She was unflappable even when she was furious. But her eyes did: a quick spark, like a lantern catching oil.

She dipped the tip of a clean glass rod into the tonic, touched it to her tongue, and closed her eyes for the briefest moment.

Sera made a small sound of protest. “You… you don’t have to…”

“Yes,” Meilin said, swallowing. “I do.”

The taste was sweetened bitterness. Herbal notes meant to sound wholesome. And under it (faint, careful, deniable), **that bitter-metal ghost** that didn’t belong in anything meant to help you “feel steady.”

Mindersand.

Meilin opened her eyes. “How often do you take this?”

Sera’s voice was small. “Every day. Just a little. The label says…”

“The label lies,” Meilin said, not unkindly. “Or the label doesn’t know.”

Sera’s shoulders tightened. “I’m not trying to accuse anyone. I’m not… I don’t want…”

“I know,” Meilin said immediately. “This is not about you starting trouble.”

Sera looked up, startled by the certainty.

Meilin’s voice stayed level, almost gentle. “This is about you stopping the shaking.”

Sera’s eyes stung. She blinked it away, embarrassed by the feeling. “Thank you,” she whispered, like she hadn’t expected to be treated like a puzzle instead of a nuisance.

Meilin set the bottle down, then reached for paper.

“Where did you buy it?” Meilin asked.

“The little shop…”

“Name,” Meilin said.

Sera hesitated, then gave it.

Meilin wrote it down.

“Who was behind the counter?” Meilin asked.

“I don’t know. A boy? He’s there sometimes.”

Meilin wrote down *sometimes* like it mattered.

“What tea stall?” Meilin asked.

“The one near…”

“Near isn’t an answer.”

Sera blinked, then (slowly, obediently) gave details: a painted sign, a chipped kettle, a vendor with scarred hands, the kind of specificity that made Meilin’s brain hum.

Meilin’s questions became stranger.

“Do you sweeten your tea?”

“Sometimes.”

“With what?”

Sera stared. “Sugar?”

“From where.”

Sera’s mouth fell open a fraction. “I… I don’t know.”

Meilin nodded as if that was the first honest thing Sera had said.

Sera’s hands twisted together. “Is this… poison?”

Meilin paused. She looked at Sera properly now: not just symptoms, but the person carrying them. Tidy handwriting. Tired eyes. Quiet competence.

“No,” Meilin said carefully. “Not the kind people imagine when they say that word.”

Sera swallowed. “Then what is it?”

Meilin tapped the bottle. “It’s control shaped like help.”

Sera’s face went blank with fear.

Meilin softened her voice again, efficient compassion. “You are not dying today. You are not in immediate danger in this room. But you are being dosed with something that wants you a little weaker than you should be.”

Sera shook her head once, barely. “Why would anyone…?”

Meilin didn’t answer the *why* yet. She started with the *how*.

She stood, crossed to her wall, and pulled down a sheet covered in marks and notes that looked like nonsense until you knew what you were seeing.

Lot symbols. Vendor names. Warehouse stamps. Routes.

Meilin added Sera’s lot mark to the sheet and drew a line from it to a small cluster of similar marks she’d circled weeks ago, after her short ship contract.

Sera watched her, brow furrowing. “What is that?”

“A map,” Meilin said.

Sera went very still. “Of me?”

Meilin glanced back. “Of a system that reached you.”

Sera’s throat worked. “I don’t want my name in…”

“Your name isn’t the story,” Meilin said, sharp enough to cut through Sera’s panic. “Your *bottle* is.”

Sera blinked, caught by the distinction.

Meilin returned to the counter and began moving with practiced speed: measuring, mixing, setting out something that would blunt the symptoms and start pulling the residue out gently instead of violently.

As her hands worked, her mind did the other work too.

She sent a message through Meredin’s channels, three short lines, nothing dramatic.

**Need distributor info for this tonic shop. Quietly.**
**Need supplier chain for tea stall near the Burrows.**
**Need lot mark cross-reference.**

Meredin’s network was good at finding people.

Meilin was good at finding patterns.

The answer came back in pieces over the next day, delivered like whispered receipts.

The tonic shop wasn’t independent. It bought from a distributor that supplied half a dozen “health” stalls across Bral.

The distributor’s crates came from two warehouses.

One warehouse stamp showed up in the places Meilin had already circled: ships’ stores, cheap supplements, tea sweeteners that made people foggy.

The other stamp was new.

But the **lot mark style** (the way it was printed, the spacing, the tiny ornamental flourish meant to look like nothing) matched something Meilin had seen once, months ago, on a sealed packet brought by a too-clean clerk.

Her father’s old lesson, resurfacing like a hook: *Cures are politics.*

Meilin sat at her bench late that night with Sera’s bottle, a scrap of the label peeled carefully off, and a borrowed shipping invoice someone had “misplaced” into Meredin’s hands.

She laid them side by side.

The lot marks lined up.

The warehouse stamp lined up.

And finally, at the bottom of the invoice (so ordinary it was almost invisible), was a name printed in respectable ink.

Smith’s Coster.

Meilin stared at it for a long moment, feeling the air change around her.

Not because the name was new.

Because now it wasn’t gossip.

Now it was a **documented line**: from Sera’s shaking hands to a warehouse, from a warehouse to a distributor, from a distributor into the mouths of people who trusted “help” because they needed it to be real.

Sera was not important enough for powerful people to notice.

Which meant whatever this was, it wasn’t personal.

It was worse.

It was scalable.

Meilin’s fingers hovered over her pen.

Then she wrote the name down in her own notebook, carefully, neatly, so there could be no argument later about what she had seen.

On the other side of the wall, the docks creaked and shifted like a restless animal.

Meilin didn’t feel triumphant.

She felt… awake.

Because she understood, with sudden clarity, exactly what she’d done.

She had taken one tired woman who wanted to stop shaking…

…and turned her into a trail.

And trails led places that didn’t like visitors.
