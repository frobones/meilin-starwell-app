# **Stage 7 — Crossing Smith’s Coster (when a pattern becomes “business”)**

## Key takeaways

- **What happens**: Meilin tries the “proper” route, documents the pattern, and brings it to **Smith’s Coster**.
- **Key antagonist**: **Corvin Hale** offers resources and “protection” in exchange for silence and procedure-through-them.
- **What she learns**: Paperwork can be a weapon; leverage is administered, not shouted.
- **Ongoing hook**: Meilin refuses the leash, triggering quiet retaliations that squeeze her life and shop.

Meilin didn’t go to war.

She tried to file a complaint.

That was the part people never understood later. When they spoke about her like she’d been born to be hunted, they missed the point. She didn’t wake up hungry for enemies. She woke up hungry for certainty, and certainty has a bad habit of walking straight through other people’s profits.

On her workbench, Sera’s tonic bottle sat beside three others bought from three different stalls, each wrapped in cloth, each labeled in Meilin’s sharp, corrective hand. Beside them: a peeled label scrap, a shipping invoice acquired through Meredin’s channels, a pinch of powder scraped from a spice tin on the *Drift-Sparrow* months ago.

A small museum of ordinary objects that all tasted wrong in the same way.

Meilin lined them up like a diagnostician laying out symptoms, and she started doing what her father taught her to do when the story got slippery:

She wrote it down.

Not poetry. Not outrage.

**Dates.**
**Lot marks.**
**Locations.**
**Onset times.**
**Shared distributors.**
**Witness names who didn’t know they were witnesses.**

She built the pattern into something hard enough to hold.

She stopped calling it “a contamination,” because that word implied accident.

It had a name now: **mindersand**, a pale, fine “drying powder” that showed up wherever people needed to be a little less difficult.

And because she was Meilin, because her curiosity outranked comfort, she didn’t stop at paper.

She tested.

Not recklessly. Never recklessly. Methodically.

Tiny controlled doses, the way she’d learned after her public near-death. She didn’t need to prove it would kill you. She needed to prove what it *did*.

Fog first. Then tremor. Then a subtle flattening of urgency, the body’s quiet agreement to be slower, softer, less difficult.

*Compliance shaped like fatigue.*

She could almost admire the design.

Almost.

The next day, she went walking.

Not like a crusader. Like a shopper.

She bought tea from the stall Sera used and asked, casually, where they got their sweetener. She watched the vendor’s hands, the way he reached for the jar without thinking, the way his eyes flicked toward a stamped crate with a too-respectable warehouse mark.

She went to the tonic shop and asked for a larger bottle, smiling like she’d been converted into a loyal customer. She listened for the little shifts in the clerk’s tone when he named his supplier, too practiced, too ready. A lie rehearsed into comfort.

“Busy season,” he said when she asked about deliveries.

Meilin nodded, friendly. “Of course.”

Then she asked the question that made his smile falter.

“Do you have the lot sheet?”

“The what?”

“The lot sheet,” Meilin repeated, pleasantly. “For quality. You sell something that people ingest, you keep your lot sheets.”

The clerk blinked, then recovered. “We don’t… we don’t really…”

Meilin tilted her head. “You don’t keep them… or you don’t *have* them?”

A heartbeat.

He reached under the counter and produced a scrap of paper with numbers written too neatly to be casual.

Meilin thanked him, paid, and left without pressing further.

That was her method: don’t start a fight at the front door. Let the truth follow you outside.

By the time she returned to her shop, Meredin’s network had delivered something better than rumor: a distributor name tied to both the tonic shop and three other “health” stalls across the docks. And, as a quiet bonus, a note from someone who worked near the warehouses:

**They’ve been moving more sealed crates at night. Same stamp. Same coin.**

Meilin stared at that line for a long time.

Night shipments were where respectable companies hid their sins.

She didn’t bring Sera into it. Not really.

She treated Sera. She adjusted the regimen. She made the tremors fade until Sera could write neatly again without clenching her jaw against shaking hands.

Sera kept trying to apologize for being the catalyst.

Meilin kept cutting her off.

“This isn’t your fault,” Meilin said, for the tenth time, tying off a small pouch of corrective herbs. “You’re a symptom.”

Sera’s face tightened. “That’s… not comforting.”

Meilin’s expression softened, just enough. “It is if you understand what I mean. Symptoms don’t deserve blame. Symptoms deserve answers.”

Sera nodded, embarrassed by the tears she refused to let fall. “Just… please,” she whispered. “Don’t let them use my name.”

Meilin’s voice went flat with certainty. “They won’t.”

And she meant it, because she’d already realized the truth:

Smith’s Coster didn’t care about Sera.

Sera was a rounding error (one tired clerk among thousands who drank what she was sold because she had to keep moving).

Meilin, though?

Meilin was someone who wrote the rounding errors down until they became a sum.

---

Her first attempt to handle it “properly” would have been laughable if it hadn’t been so dangerous.

She went to a Smith’s Coster office.

Not with a torch. With a folder.

A building that smelled of fresh varnish and clean paper, guarded by clerks with tidy hair and eyes that slid past you like you were an inconvenience. A place designed to make you feel unclean for having a body.

Meilin asked for whoever handled “quality concerns.”

She was led into a small room with a polished table and a pitcher of water she didn’t touch.

A man arrived wearing respectable clothes and a smile that practiced kindness like a trade. “Corvin Hale,” he introduced himself, as if the name should have done the rest of the work for him.

“Miss Starwell,” he said, as if he’d been expecting her. “I’m told you have… questions.”

Meilin set her folder down and opened it.

She didn’t accuse. She didn’t rant. She showed.

Samples labeled by hand. Lot marks copied carefully. Dates. Stall names. Distributor receipts.

The man’s smile remained, but his eyes changed (subtle, like a lock turning).

“This is quite thorough,” he said.

“It has to be,” Meilin replied. “People are getting dosed. It’s subtle, but it’s consistent. I want to know what you’re cutting these products with.”

The man’s smile widened by a fraction. “And you assume it’s us.”

Meilin didn’t blink. “I assume nothing. I traced the supply chain. Your name is on the invoices.”

He leaned back in his chair, fingers steepled, as if impressed despite himself. “You understand, Miss Starwell, that many distributors use our warehouses. Our stamp doesn’t mean intent.”

“Then it should be easy for you to tell me who handled the batches,” Meilin said. “And to stop it.”

The man regarded her for a long moment. Then he reached for her folder, not to take it, but to touch the edge, lightly, as if claiming the right to be near it.

“You have a sharp mind,” he said. “That’s rare. And useful.”

Meilin’s stomach tightened. “I’m not for sale.”

He chuckled softly, as if she’d made a charming joke. “Everyone is,” he said. “The only question is whether you’re paid in coin or… circumstances.”

Meilin’s voice went colder. “Is that a threat?”

“It’s a kindness,” he replied smoothly. “You could bring this to inspectors. You could make noise. And then you’d discover how unpleasant it is to be noisy on the Rock of Bral.”

He slid a small envelope across the table.

A contract. Clean paper. Heavy promise.

“Work with us,” he said. “Officially. Excellent pay. Resources. Protection. You can ensure quality across a wide network. You can do real good, Miss Starwell, without putting yourself in danger.”

Meilin looked at the envelope as if it were a jar of poison with good marketing.

Corvin Hale didn’t push it at her. He didn’t have to. The room did the pushing for him: the polished table that never saw blood, the clean water she wouldn’t drink, the quiet certainty that paperwork could be sharper than blades.

“You don’t like the word ‘leash,’” Hale said mildly. “Fine. Call it a *position*.”

He opened the envelope just enough that she could see the ink without taking it (like offering a scent, not a bite).

“A retainer,” he said. “A license that makes inspectors smile instead of linger. Access to suppliers that don’t sell to dockside stalls. A workspace that isn’t wedged between rope tar and fish brine.” His smile warmed by a fraction. “You could stop chasing rumors and start correcting them.”

Meilin’s gaze stayed flat. “By working for the people who profit from the rumors.”

Hale’s hands spread slightly, palms up (reasonable). “By working for the people who can afford to fix the system you’re currently losing to. You’re good at patterns. You’re good at bodies. You’re not good at leverage. Not yet.”

He let that land like a diagnosis.

“And what do you want?” Meilin asked.

Hale’s smile didn’t change. “Silence,” he said, as if naming an ingredient. “Or, if you can’t manage silence, then at least… procedure. You submit findings through proper channels. You stop buying samples off dock tables. You stop making the docks nervous.”

“You mean,” Meilin said, “I stop being independent.”

Hale’s eyes flicked (barely). “I mean you stop being *exposed*.”

Meilin didn’t touch the contract. “And if I refuse your protection?”

Hale’s voice stayed gentle, which was the point. “Then the world becomes less convenient for you,” he said. “A supplier decides you’re ‘difficult.’ A landlord remembers a clause. A dock inspector finds the time to be thorough. A clinic ‘misplaces’ a referral. None of it is personal. It’s just… administration.”

Administration. The word wore a smile like a mask.

“You want a leash,” she said.

His smile did not move. “I want to prevent misunderstandings.”

Meilin closed her folder. “No.”

The room cooled.

For the first time, the man’s eyes showed something real: annoyance, perhaps, or a calculation changing shape.

“You’re making this difficult,” he said.

Meilin stood. “I’m making it documented.”

His voice stayed gentle. “Think carefully. The docks can become very small for people who refuse reasonable arrangements.”

Meilin looked him in the eye. “Then you should have thought carefully before you started dosing people who can’t afford to notice.”

She walked out with her folder still in her hands.

And that was when the city began to shrink.

---

It started politely.

A supplier who’d known her since childhood suddenly couldn’t meet her gaze. “Out of stock,” he murmured, even as she saw the crates behind him.

A dock inspector arrived at her shop with papers that smelled freshly forged (too crisp, too eager). He lingered near her shelves, pretending to count jars while actually counting *options*.

Patients began to hesitate at her door, glancing over their shoulders before slipping inside. One of them, a young deckhand, confessed in a whisper: “Someone followed me from the corner. I think they’re watching who comes here.”

Meilin felt anger, but she treated anger the way she treated pain:

Data.

She noted times. Faces. Routes. The way tails changed when they realized she’d spotted them.

Then came the “friendly” message (the kind meant to sound like concern).

A different Smith’s Coster representative appeared at the edge of the docks, not in an office. No polished table. No water pitcher. Just open air and the creak of gangplanks. Her posture was relaxed in the way a knife could be relaxed.

They didn’t approach her shop. They waited where she couldn’t pretend she hadn’t seen them.

Meilin stopped, satchel heavy at her hip, and regarded them like a specimen.

“Miss Starwell,” Elowen Pryce said. “We’d prefer not to escalate.”

Meilin’s mouth twitched. “Then don’t.”

The rep smiled faintly, as if amused by her lack of fear. “Your refusal was noted. We can be flexible. Perhaps the contract terms weren’t… to your taste.”

Meilin didn’t answer.

The rep continued, voice low. “You are very good at what you do. That’s why this is fixable. You can take the work, take the resources, and stop making problems for yourself.”

“And if I don’t?” Meilin asked.

The rep’s gaze slid past her, toward the flow of dock life (people hauling crates, laughing, coughing, surviving).

“If you don’t,” the rep said softly, “you’ll learn what it costs to be correct in public.”

Meilin’s fingers tightened around her satchel strap.

“I’m not correct in public,” she said. “I’m correct on paper.”

The rep’s smile sharpened. “Paper burns.”

Meilin stared at them a long moment, measuring their posture, their breathing, the confidence that came from believing the world could be bought.

Then she said, calmly, “Tell your employers something for me.”

The rep lifted a brow. “Yes?”

Meilin’s voice was clinical, almost bored. “I already forgave the wrong person once.”

The rep’s smile faded.

Meilin walked away.

Behind her, the docks kept moving. But she felt it now. The net was tightening, the pressure turning from inconvenience into intent.

That night, Meredin’s runner, Nori, came to her door and didn’t bother with pleasantries.

“They’re asking about you,” the runner said. “Quietly. Not your patients. Not your friends. You.”

Meilin nodded once, already knowing. “I made it too provable.”

The runner’s gaze sharpened. “Can you stop?”

Meilin looked past them, toward the shelf where Sera’s corrected regimen sat ready, toward the wall where lot marks and stamps had become a living map.

“No,” she said.

The runner exhaled through their teeth. “Then you need to be smarter.”

Meilin’s eyes went bright again (the worrying kind, the dangerous kind).

“I am,” she said.

And for the first time, she didn’t mean “smarter” as in “more careful.”

She meant it as in: **if paper burns, you steal the match.**
