# **Stage 8 — The leverage theft (the Ledger Page)**

## Key takeaways

- **What happens**: Meredin warns Smith’s Coster is tightening; Meilin chooses leverage over complaint.
- **Key ally**: **Bram Cale** gets her inside a warehouse long enough for one decisive action.
- **The proof**: She steals a single ledger page tying **MS-13 mindersand** to distribution and intent (“increase compliance”).
- **Ongoing hook**: The missing page turns suspicion into certainty. Smith’s Coster now knows someone was inside.

Meredin didn’t tell Meilin to run.

Meredin told her the weather.

“They’re tightening,” Meredin said, standing in the same narrow space between warehouses where conversations stayed alive by staying brief. Their voice held no panic (just math). “Not loud. Not yet. But they’re mapping your habits.”

Meilin’s stomach went cold in that familiar, useful way. “They already tried to leash me.”

Meredin nodded. “Now they’ll try to make you isolated enough that the leash feels like relief.”

Meilin pictured it instantly: suppliers who wouldn’t sell, patients too afraid to come, the shop becoming quiet until it felt like a coffin with jars.

“What do you want me to do?” Meilin asked.

Meredin studied her. “What you’re best at,” they said. “Stop treating symptoms.”

Meilin didn’t blink. “You mean…”

“I mean leverage,” Meredin replied, as if naming an herb. “They don’t move this carefully without paper behind it.”

Meilin felt her pulse quicken (not fear, not exactly). The bright-eyed worry-flicker that made friends step back.

“Paper burns,” Meilin said, remembering the representative’s smile.

Meredin’s gaze stayed steady. “Then don’t bring them paper that burns. Bring them paper they can’t afford to admit exists.”

Meilin’s mouth went dry.

A ledger. Not a rumor. Not a pattern she’d stitched together from scraps.

**Their own handwriting. Their own lot marks. Their own proof.**

Meredin’s voice lowered. “There’s a warehouse clerk in the Burrows who wants out (Bram Cale). Smith’s Coster keeps him by the throat. He can get you inside for minutes. Not long. But long enough to take *one page*.”

“One page,” Meilin repeated.

Meredin’s eyes sharpened. “One page. You don’t steal a ledger. You steal what it *does* to them.”

Meilin inhaled slowly. “If I do this… they’ll come for me.”

Meredin nodded once. “Yes.”

Meilin’s expression didn’t change, but something in her set like a bone knitting.

“Good,” she said softly. “Then they’ll stop coming for my patients.”

Meredin watched her a moment longer, then said, almost like a warning disguised as respect, “You understand what you’re doing.”

Meilin’s answer came without hesitation. “I’m stealing someone’s leverage back.”

The night she went, Bral’s docks were quieter than usual (low tide for trouble, the kind of lull that made people uneasy because it felt unearned).

Meilin didn’t dress like a thief. That would have been theatrical.

She dressed like a dockside apothecary: practical braid, sleeves rolled, cloak plain enough to be forgettable. Her satchel held the usual vials wrapped in cloth so they didn’t clink, a strip of wax paper, a stub of chalk, and (most importantly) Kaito Starwell’s old habit made portable:

A small, blank notebook with clean pages.

Because if she survived the night, she wanted the truth to survive with her.

The warehouse sat at the edge of respectable trade. Too clean for the Burrows, too close to the docks to be “above it.” A place where crates moved under lanternlight and men pretended they didn’t see whose stamp was on the wax.

The clerk met her in shadow beneath an overhang, shoulders hunched like he’d been made smaller by years of yes-sir. Bram Cale looked like a man who’d been taught to apologize for breathing.

He didn’t look at her face. He looked at her hands.

“You’re sure?” he whispered.

Meilin didn’t lie. “No.”

He swallowed. “They’ll ruin me.”

Meilin’s voice stayed even. “They already own you. I’m offering you an exit you can live through.”

The clerk’s eyes flicked up (one desperate heartbeat of hope) then away again. “Minutes,” he said. “That’s all.”

Meilin nodded.

He led her along the side of the building where the lanterns didn’t quite reach, to a narrow service door with a lock that looked expensive enough to be offended by honest work. His hands shook as he slid a key in.

It clicked.

The sound was small, but it felt loud enough to wake the whole Rock.

Inside, the warehouse smelled like wealth trying to be sterile: dry grain, wax, ink, and the faint chemical sweetness of “preservatives” that weren’t meant to be tasted.

Crates rose in orderly towers. Seals glinted in the dim like eyes.

The clerk moved quickly, like a man trying not to think. “Office is there,” he whispered, gesturing down a corridor. “Ledger’s kept in the inner drawer. Don’t… don’t touch anything else.”

Meilin followed, counting steps, noting exits, letting her mind do the calm work it did when the stakes were life and death. Not adrenaline. Procedure.

At the office door, the clerk stopped. His breath came short. “I can’t go in.”

“You don’t need to,” Meilin said.

His eyes were wet. “You don’t understand. They’ll know…”

Meilin’s gaze was steady. “I understand exactly. Go.”

He hesitated, then melted back into the dark like he’d never been there.

Meilin was alone.

The office door was locked.

She didn’t force it. Forcing things left stories.

She drew a small hook from her satchel (an apothecary’s tool repurposed, nothing fancy) and worked the lock with the same patience she used when teasing a splinter out of a finger.

Click.

She slipped inside and closed the door behind her.

The office was neat in the way Vale kept inventory: not pretty, just controlled. A desk. A lamp. A stack of shipping forms. A stamp block with wax seals arranged by size. A clean quill. A shallow bowl of sand for drying ink.

And a ledger drawer, exactly where Meredin said it would be.

Meilin’s heartbeat was a quiet drum, steady enough to count.

She opened the drawer.

The ledger was heavier than she expected (thick pages bound in leather, edges worn by careful hands). It wasn’t a storybook. It was a weapon.

Meilin didn’t flip aimlessly. She had a target: the lot mark style she’d traced from Sera’s tonic, from tea sweeteners, from ship stores that made crews fogged and compliant.

She found it on the third page she turned.

A neat column of lot marks. A corresponding column of “contents.” Another column of “destination.” Another column of “notes,” written in the kind of shorthand people used when they assumed nobody outside their circle would ever read it.

Meilin’s throat tightened.

Because there it was, in ink as ordinary as any grocery list:

An additive entry written as code, but not so coded it couldn’t be read if you knew what to look for:

**MS-13: mindersand** (listed as “drying powder”).

A distribution route that touched half the docks, repacked, renamed, and dribbled into the everyday things people swallowed without thinking: tea sweeteners, “fatigue” tonics, shipboard spice tins.

A note beside certain shipments that made her stomach turn with its casual cruelty: something like **“increase compliance”** written as if compliance were a spice you could add to stew.

This wasn’t accidental contamination.

This was a recipe.

Meilin forced her hands to stay steady. Her father’s voice echoed in her head (not as sentiment, but as method):

*Symptoms are messages.*

*People lie. Bodies don’t.*

*Cures are politics.*

She had seconds, not minutes, for what she wanted to do next.

Option one: take the ledger.

Impossible. Too big. Too obvious. Too easy to hunt.

Option two: copy everything.

Also impossible. Her handwriting was precise, but time was a predator.

So she did the thing that made her dangerous.

She stole a **responsible amount** of truth.

Meilin slipped a strip of wax paper beneath the page she needed: one specific leaf with the lot marks, **MS-13 mindersand** written in that tidy, criminal hand, the destinations, and the marginal note that made intent undeniable.

Not for drama. Just a clean backer, so her hands wouldn’t smudge ink or leave telltale grime, and so the blade could whisper through paper without biting the sheet beneath.

She took out a small blade (sharp, clean, used for cutting bandage).

She didn’t tear. Tearing was emotional. She cut.

The blade whispered through paper, a sound so soft it felt like blasphemy.

She removed the page in one careful motion.

Then she did something that made her pause, just once.

She looked at the empty space in the ledger.

A missing tooth.

A gap that would be noticed the moment someone cared to look.

Her pulse quickened. Not from fear. From the strange, cold satisfaction of *consequence*.

Because now Smith’s Coster wouldn’t just suspect someone knew.

They would know someone had been inside their mouth.

Meilin slid the severed page into her notebook, pressed it flat, and closed it with reverence.

She returned the ledger to the drawer exactly as she found it.

She smoothed the top stack of papers. She set the quill back precisely. She left the office as if she’d never existed.

Halfway down the corridor, she froze.

Footsteps.

Not running. Not hurried. Just the casual pace of someone who belonged there.

Meilin pressed herself into the shadow between two crate towers, heart quieting into stillness. She tasted the air: wax, grain, ink. She felt her own breath become a discipline.

A man passed, carrying a lantern. The light spilled across the crates in slow arcs.

For a moment, his face was close enough that Meilin could have reached out and touched him.

He didn’t look her way.

He didn’t have to.

He paused by the office door, as if listening.

Meilin held her breath until her lungs ached.

The man opened the door.

Light spilled out, then swallowed back in.

A heartbeat.

Two.

Then the man came out again, still unhurried. He adjusted the lantern’s handle and continued down the corridor like nothing was wrong.

Meilin didn’t move until the footsteps faded into the warehouse’s deeper belly.

Only then did she exhale, slow and controlled, and slip toward the service door.

Outside, the night air hit her like permission.

She walked, not ran, back into the dockside dark.

Because running made you memorable.

Meilin Starwell survived by being forgettable until the moment she mattered.

---

She didn’t go home.

She went straight to Meredin’s chosen safe place: a back room that smelled of old wood and cheap tea (which she did not drink), lit by a single lamp and guarded by the kind of silence that meant *nobody asks why you’re here*.

Meredin arrived without drama, as always.

Meilin set the notebook on the table and opened it.

The ledger page lay there like a living thing.

Meredin’s eyes flicked over it, fast and competent. Their expression didn’t change, but their voice lowered.

“This is… clean,” they said. “Intent. Distribution. Lot marks.”

Meilin’s mouth felt numb. “Yes.”

Meredin looked up. “Any names?”

Meilin swallowed. Here was the moment she’d promised herself: the moral line made practical.

“No,” she said immediately. “Not the ones that would get Sera killed. Not the ones that would drag my patients into this. If her name exists anywhere near this, it stays buried.”

Meredin studied her for a long beat.

Then they nodded once, approval stripped of warmth because warmth would be dangerous. “Good,” they said. “You stole leverage. Not lives.”

Meilin’s hands clenched, then relaxed. She hadn’t realized they were shaking until they stopped.

Meredin’s gaze sharpened. “You understand what happens now.”

Meilin stared at the ledger page.

They would notice the missing leaf.

They would hunt for whoever had taken it.

They would not care about the tired clerk or the quiet customer.

They would care about the person who could turn their own ink into a noose.

Meilin closed the notebook gently, as if closing a wound.

“I know,” she said.

And that was the moment she became someone who couldn’t go back to “normal” dock life.

Not because she’d made noise.

Because she’d made proof.

---

When she finally returned to her shop before dawn, she washed her hands until her skin stung.

She didn’t sleep.

She sat at her workbench and stared at the quiet rows of jars, listening to the docks breathe outside.

Her father came down the stairs at some point (hair tousled, eyes sharp despite the hour) and took one look at her face.

“What did you do?” he asked, softly.

Meilin didn’t answer.

Not because she didn’t trust him.

Because naming it made it easier for the world to repeat.

Her father’s gaze drifted to the way her satchel sat heavier than it should, to the faint smear of ink at her thumb, to the controlled stillness of a person trying not to rattle.

He exhaled. “You stole someone’s leverage back.”

Meilin’s eyes flicked up, startled.

Her father’s mouth tightened. “You always did have your mother’s talent for making trouble look like a diagnosis.”

Meilin gave a single humorless breath that might have been a laugh in a different life.

Her father stepped closer and put a hand on her shoulder (firm, grounding).

“You won’t talk about it,” he said.

Meilin’s voice came out quiet. “No.”

He nodded once, accepting the shape of the thing without demanding to hold it.

Then he said the sentence that made her throat tighten:

“Then we plan.”

Because in the distance, beyond the thin walls of their shop, the docks were already beginning to feel smaller.

And somewhere in a Smith’s Coster ledger, there was now a gap.

A missing page.

A problem.

Her problem.
