# **Stage 4 — Meredin Sandyfoot’s quiet patronage**

## Key takeaways

- **What happens**: Off-books patients start arriving with “pay later —M” notes; the name **Meredin Sandyfoot** keeps surfacing.
- **What Meilin learns**: In the Burrows, protection looks like *coverage*: doors opening, trouble redirected, no official paper.
- **Key relationship**: Meilin meets Meredin (no romance, no ownership); a mutual reliance on reliability and discretion.
- **Ongoing hook**: Meredin routes vulnerable people to Meilin and quietly blunts pressures that would otherwise crush her shop.

Meredin Sandyfoot didn’t arrive like a patron.

There was no dramatic entrance, no entourage, no gleaming signet ring flashed as proof of importance. The first time Meilin heard the name, it came out of a dockhand’s mouth the way sailors spoke of weather: practical, respectful, and edged with warning.

“You want this to stay quiet,” the dockhand said, hovering in the doorway with his cap twisting in his hands. “You take it to Meredin.”

Meilin looked up from grinding dried root. “And who’s Meredin?”

The dockhand hesitated, as if saying it aloud might summon trouble. “Someone who keeps the Burrows from eating itself.”

That was a strange description, but Meilin had learned to trust strange descriptions. They were usually truer than neat ones.

It wasn’t Meredin who came first. It was Meredin’s work.

A girl (twelve, maybe thirteen) was brought in late one night by a woman with a knife scar along her jaw and exhaustion in her eyes. The girl’s skin was too pale, her lips a touch blue, her breath shallow like she was trying not to take up space.

“She can’t go to the clinics,” the woman said quickly. “They’ll ask questions.”

Meilin’s father, Kaito Starwell, glanced at Meilin, then at the girl. “Questions about what?”

The woman’s jaw tightened. “About why she’s alone. About who she belongs to.”

Meilin’s hand stilled over the mortar.

Her father said, simply, “Put her on the table.”

As Meilin worked (listening, testing, measuring), she realized the girl wasn’t cursed, wasn’t possessed, wasn’t anything the dock gossips would have made poetic.

She was starved.

Not of food. Of *safety*. Of consistency. Of the kind of sleep that lets the body stop bracing for the next blow.

Meilin treated the symptoms anyway, because that’s what you did when you couldn’t treat the world.

When the girl finally slept, the woman with the scar leaned on the counter and exhaled like she’d been holding her breath for a month.

“You didn’t ask,” she said.

Meilin wiped her hands. “Ask what?”

“Who we are,” the woman said. “What we did. Why we can’t go anywhere official.”

Meilin’s mouth tightened. “If you needed me to judge you, you’d have gone somewhere with cleaner floors.”

The woman stared at her for a long moment. Then she laughed once (sharp, surprised). “All right,” she said. “Meredin was right about you.”

Meilin felt her father’s eyes shift, subtle, attentive.

“Meredin?” her father asked.

The woman nodded. “Sandyfoot. They said you’d help without turning it into a sermon.”

Meilin’s father didn’t react the way people reacted to big names. He just said, “Who sent you?”

The woman hesitated, then pulled a folded scrap of paper from her pocket. No seal. No crest. Just a line of tidy handwriting:

**For the girl. Pay later. —M**

It wasn’t money. It was an *introduction*.

Meilin read it, then looked up. “So Meredin collects debts.”

The woman’s gaze was steady. “Meredin remembers favors.”

That was the first time Meilin understood what protection looked like in the Burrows.

Not guards at your door.

Not official papers.

Just… *doors that opened* when they should have stayed shut. People who didn’t ask your name when they should have. A whisper that made trouble drift elsewhere, like smoke redirected by a hand you couldn’t see.

Over the next months, the pattern repeated.

A stevedore who “fell” and broke two fingers, except the bruises on his arm said he’d been held down.
A messenger with a fever who insisted it was “nothing” because “they can’t have me missing work.”
A dock cook with a cough that smelled faintly of sweetener and rot.

They came in with the same quiet urgency and the same careful distance from anything official. And always, somewhere in the story, the same name floated like a low tide mark: Meredin.

Meilin met Meredin Sandyfoot at last in a place that wasn’t a throne room and wasn’t a tavern.

It was a narrow space between two warehouses where the air smelled of damp canvas and stored grain. A spot people used for quick conversations because nobody lingered there unless they had to.

Meredin was smaller than Meilin expected: compact, grounded, built like someone who’d learned to take up only the space they needed. Their eyes were the notable part: not warm, not cruel, just awake in a way that suggested they counted everything.

They didn’t greet Meilin like a savior or a tool. They greeted her like a craftsman meeting another craftsman.

“Starwell,” Meredin said. Not *Mei-mei*. Not a nickname. The name as it appeared on paper.

Meilin’s fingers tightened around her satchel strap. “Sandyfoot.”

Meredin’s mouth twitched at the formality. “You’re careful.”

“I’m alive,” Meilin replied.

Meredin nodded once, as if that answered a question they’d been carrying. “I heard you forgave Hask.”

Meilin blinked. “Everyone heard.”

“Not everyone approved,” Meredin said.

Meilin snorted softly. “Crowds like villains.”

“And you refused to give them one,” Meredin said. “That makes you harder to steer.”

Meilin’s eyes narrowed. “Is this the part where you tell me what you want?”

Meredin didn’t flinch. “I want you to keep doing what you’re doing.”

“That’s a bad investment,” Meilin said. “I make people angry.”

Meredin’s gaze stayed steady. “You make the right people angry.”

Meilin let that land. The damp air. The distant thump of cargo. The feeling of being assessed.

“And what do you get?” Meilin asked.

Meredin’s answer was immediate. “Fewer funerals.”

That was the first thing Meredin said that sounded almost like sentiment.

Almost.

Then they continued, businesslike again: “The clinics are political. The docks are vulnerable. People get sick and they can’t afford to be seen sick. You treat them. Quietly. Efficiently.”

Meilin tilted her head. “And when someone comes looking for me?”

Meredin’s eyes flicked, just once, toward the mouth of the alley, where a pair of dock-watchmen passed without looking in.

“They won’t find you,” Meredin said. “Not easily.”

Meilin felt a cold certainty settle in her stomach. “So it’s protection.”

“It’s coverage,” Meredin corrected, like the distinction mattered. “I don’t own you.”

“I don’t belong to anyone,” Meilin said, sharply enough that it surprised her.

Meredin held up a hand, palm out, calm. “Good. I don’t need ownership. I need reliability.”

Meilin exhaled slowly. “Reliability costs.”

“Yes,” Meredin agreed. “So does being alone.”

That was how Meredin worked: no promises they couldn’t keep, no romance, no speeches. Just a practical triangle of needs.

They routed patients to Meilin who couldn’t go anywhere else.
Meilin kept those people functional, alive, working, breathing.
And in return, Meredin made sure the little pressures that had begun to gather around Meilin’s shop (“random” inspections, missing shipments, sudden shortages) didn’t quite land.

Not because Meredin could stop them.

Because Meredin could *redirect* them.

A dock inspector arrived with questions and found himself urgently needed elsewhere.
A supplier who’d “run out” of stock suddenly found a crate “miscounted” in his own ledger and decided, sheepishly, that yes, he did have what Meilin needed after all.
A rough-looking man who lingered too long outside the shop got gently, firmly steered into a different alley by people who didn’t wear uniforms.

Meilin didn’t ask how. She was learning the rules of this arrangement: you didn’t demand to see the gears if you wanted the machine to keep running.

The real cost came in the favors.

They weren’t asked for with threats. That was the clever part. They were asked for like necessities.

Meredin’s runner, Nori, would appear at the door with a tired expression and a polite tone.

“Meredin’s asking,” the runner would say, “if you can look at someone. Off-books.”

Meilin would say yes.

Not because she liked being used. She hated the implication. But she’d seen what happened to people who were “off-books” and untreated.

Sometimes the patient was a laborer who’d taken a bad fall and needed their ribs wrapped well enough to keep working. Sometimes it was a kid with shaking hands and a too-fast heart. Sometimes it was a courier whose “fatigue” smelled faintly, unmistakably, of something cut into their tea.

Meilin would treat them.

And Meredin would remember.

The first time Meilin felt the web tighten, it wasn’t a threat.

It was a question asked like an apology.

Nori arrived near midnight with a boy barely old enough to shave and a bruise blooming under his collar like spilled ink. The boy wore a clerk’s coat that tried hard to look clean, but the seams were damp with dock air and panic.

“He won’t go upstairs,” Nori said quietly. “He won’t go anywhere official.”

Meilin didn’t ask why. She didn’t need to. The boy’s hands told the story: ink-stained fingertips, nail beds bitten raw, the tremor of someone who’d been instructed to be brave and hadn’t been given the tools.

“Who hit you?” Meilin asked anyway, because bodies still deserved names.

The boy swallowed. “I… fell.”

Meilin looked at the bruise again, oval, edged, too neat for a fall. “Again,” she said, not cruel, just patient.

The boy’s eyes slid to Nori, then to the floor. “Someone from… Smith’s Coster,” he whispered, like the name itself could file paperwork against him. “I moved a crate I wasn’t supposed to look at. They said I’d be ‘reassigned.’”

Meilin felt her father’s lesson click into place like a latch: cures are politics. So were injuries. So were crates.

She treated the boy without sermon or spectacle: wrapped ribs, eased pain, checked his breath until it didn’t hitch like a confession. When she was done, she washed her hands and found Nori still there, lingering the way people lingered when the bill wasn’t coin.

“Meredin’s asking,” Nori said again, softer this time, “if you can keep that name out of your mouth.”

Meilin’s jaw tightened. “I don’t trade in names.”

Nori’s expression flickered with relief and something like shame. “Good,” they said. Then, because honesty was a kind of currency too: “They’ll try to make it sound like he disappeared on his own.”

Meilin glanced back at the boy (eyes wide, trying not to cry, trying to stay real).

The web didn’t feel like a chain. It felt like responsibility.

And that, Meilin realized, was how Meredin’s coverage worked: not by making you afraid to say no, but by making you understand exactly who would pay if you did.

It wasn’t a chain. It was a web. A net that caught you softly and then didn’t let go.

One evening, after a long day of cases, Meilin found her father sitting with his notebook open, but not writing. His eyes looked older than they had a year ago.

“You’re in deep,” he said without looking up.

Meilin set down her satchel. “I’m useful.”

Her father’s pen hovered. “Useful is a kind of target.”

Meilin’s jaw tightened. “So is being right.”

Her father finally looked at her. “And that’s the danger. You’re becoming right in ways that touch money.”

Meilin thought of her wall of marks. Of lot symbols repeating. Of certain shipments that always preceded certain symptoms.

“I’m not trying to start a fight,” she said quietly.

Her father’s expression softened by a fraction. “No,” he agreed. “That’s why it’s worse. People forgive fights. They don’t forgive diagnoses.”

Meilin went to her wall and traced the newest line she’d drawn between a warehouse mark and a name she’d seen too often in dock gossip. She didn’t say it out loud.

Not yet.

But she felt the edge of it.

The city was starting to notice she noticed.

And now, thanks to Meredin, she had coverage.

Which meant she also had **a stake**.

Because if she fell, it wouldn’t just be her.

It would be all the people who’d been able to come to her without getting eaten alive by “official” questions.

Meilin stared at the web of marks and felt the web tighten back, invisible around her ribs.

Protection was real.

So were obligations.

And somewhere out there, beyond the polite clinics and the public docks, someone would eventually decide that both were inconvenient.
