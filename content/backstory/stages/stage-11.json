  "content": "The ledger page didn't make the city explode.\n\nIt made it quiet.\n\nThat was the worst part.\n\nNo open threats. No dramatic raid on her shop. No blade in an alley meant to teach a lesson. Smith's Coster didn't do drama when accounting would do.\n\nThey did absence.\n\nThey did pressure so polite it could be denied.\n\nWithin two days, Meilin could feel it the way you felt a fever before it broke, subtle heat under the skin of the docks.\n\nA supplier who'd always grumbled but always sold to her turned his sign to CLOSED when he saw her coming.\nA second supplier offered her what she needed at triple price, smiling apologetically as if scarcity were weather.\nA dock-watchman who used to nod at her father now stared too long, eyes blank with instruction.\n\nPatients still came (because illness doesn't care who owns the warehouses), but they came like shadows. They entered her shop fast, heads down, and left faster. More than one glanced behind them before stepping inside, fingers tight around their own sleeves like they could hide their fear in cloth.\n\nSera came on the third day, slipping in at dusk.\n\nHer tremors were better. Her handwriting had steadied enough that she looked like herself again, which made the exhaustion in her eyes somehow worse, because now it was purely emotional.\n\n\"They followed me,\" she whispered as soon as the door shut.\n\nMeilin didn't ask who. She only asked the useful questions.\n\n\"From where?\"\n\n\"The corner by the chandlery. A man with a cap. He didn't look at me. He just… matched my pace.\"\n\nMeilin nodded once. Data.\n\n\"Did he approach?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Good,\" Meilin said, and meant it. \"They're not after you.\"\n\nSera's breath hitched. \"How can you be sure?\"\n\nMeilin's expression didn't soften, but her voice did. \"Because you're not the problem they need to solve.\"\n\nSera flinched anyway, because truth can still hurt even when it's comforting.\n\nSera swallowed. \"What did you do?\"\n\nMeilin's fingers stilled for half a heartbeat.\n\nThen she said the only honest thing she could without turning Sera into a weapon:\n\n\"I made it so they can't pretend mindersand is an accident.\"\n\nSera stared at her, fear and admiration tangled into something that looked like dread. \"Meilin…\"\n\nMeilin cut her off, sharper than she meant to. \"Your name stays out of this.\"\n\nSera's hands clenched. \"I don't want to be leverage.\"\n\n\"You won't be,\" Meilin said, voice like a sealed jar.\n\nSera looked down, then up again, desperate. \"Then what happens?\"\n\nMeilin didn't answer immediately.\n\nBecause the answer had footsteps.\n\nA knock sounded at the door.\n\nNot urgent. Not violent.\n\nPolite.\n\nMeilin felt her entire body go still in the way it did when someone's lungs stopped moving right. She glanced at her father (Kaito Starwell), and he was already moving, already between the door and the stairs, his presence a quiet wall.\n\nThe knock came again.\n\nMeilin didn't open the door.\n\nShe watched her father reach for the latch with the same calm he used when picking up a scalpel.\n\nHe opened it a handspan.\n\nA man stood outside, clean enough to be out of place and careful enough to belong anywhere. Not a dockhand. Not a watchman. His smile was practiced into something that could pass for kindness.\n\n\"Master Starwell,\" the man said smoothly, as if old acquaintance existed where only pressure did. \"And Miss Starwell. I apologize for disturbing you.\"\n\nMeilin's father didn't return the greeting. \"State your business.\"\n\nThe man's eyes flicked (briefly) over her father's shoulder, over Meilin's ink-stained hands, over Sera half-hidden behind a shelf like a guilty thought.\n\nThe smile didn't change.\n\n\"Pender Holt,\" he said, as if the name were its own permission. \"I represent a party that values discretion. There's been… concern. A misunderstanding involving documentation.\"\n\nMeilin's stomach tightened.\n\nShe stepped forward before her father could answer. \"There's no misunderstanding,\" Meilin said.\n\nThe man's gaze settled on her like a ledger closing. \"Miss Starwell. You have an impressive mind. Your thoroughness is admired.\"\n\nMeilin's mouth twitched. \"That's not admiration. That's inventory.\"\n\nThe man's smile widened a fraction, amused despite himself. \"Perhaps. Either way, we'd like to resolve this privately. It would be unfortunate if your work became… complicated.\"\n\nMeilin's eyes went cold. \"It already has.\"\n\nThe man sighed, as if she'd forced him into something tedious. \"Then let me speak plainly. You can accept a position. Excellent pay. Resources. Clean work. Or you can continue as you are and discover how easy it is to make a small shop vanish under paperwork.\"\n\nMeilin felt Sera's breath behind her, shallow and scared.\n\nMeilin kept her voice flat. \"If you have paperwork, file it.\"\n\nThe man's smile thinned. \"We will.\"\n\nMeilin held his gaze. \"And if you're here about *documentation*… you should know that what I have isn't the kind you can burn without smoke.\"\n\nThe man's eyes sharpened for the first time.\n\nThere. A real reaction.\n\nThen he recovered, the smile sliding back into place like a mask. \"We'll be in touch,\" he said politely. \"I recommend you think carefully.\"\n\nHe tipped his head, almost respectful, and turned away.\n\nWhen the door shut, the shop felt smaller by a foot.\n\nSera's voice shook. \"That was them.\"\n\nMeilin nodded. \"Yes.\"\n\nSera's hands twisted together. \"They didn't even look at me.\"\n\nMeilin swallowed. \"I told you.\"\n\nSera stared at her like she was seeing the shape of the world too clearly for the first time.\n\nMeilin's father closed his eyes briefly (an older man's version of exhaling around a wound). \"They're testing,\" he said.\n\nMeilin's gaze went to her wall of marks, to the tidy web she'd built. \"They're measuring,\" she corrected.\n\nHer father looked at her. \"Then we stop them.\"\n\nMeilin met his eyes. \"We can't stop them here.\"\n\nA beat of silence.\n\nThen her father nodded once, like a man accepting a diagnosis he'd hoped would be wrong.\n\n---\n\nMeredin arrived after midnight.\n\nNot at the front door. In the back, the way people arrived when they didn't want witnesses.\n\nMeredin's face was calm, but their eyes were hard.\n\n\"They came to your shop,\" Meredin said.\n\nMeilin didn't ask how they knew. \"Yes.\"\n\nMeredin's gaze flicked to Sera sitting stiffly on a stool, hands clenched, trying to disappear.\n\n\"Is she…\" Meredin began.\n\n\"She stays out of it,\" Meilin said immediately.\n\nMeredin's eyes narrowed, then eased. \"Good.\"\n\nMeilin leaned forward. \"They're going to choke my suppliers next. Then they'll choke my patients. Then they'll choke *Meredin's* people through me.\"\n\nMeredin didn't deny it. \"Yes.\"\n\nMeilin's voice was quiet, but the iron in it was unmistakable. \"So what's the gap.\"\n\nMeredin's mouth twitched. It wasn't a smile. It was the recognition of someone who respected competence.\n\n\"There's a ship leaving,\" Meredin said. \"Crew needs a medic. A quiet berth. Not registered loudly. It will be… difficult for Smith's Coster to put hands on you in transit.\"\n\nMeilin's pulse jumped.\n\n\"A ship,\" she said, and heard the echo of her first contract, the way the void had felt like fewer exits and therefore clearer rules.\n\nMeredin nodded. \"Your name is already being traded in small circles. If you stay, they'll make you either broke or obedient. If you leave, you're still a problem… but you're a problem they can't box into a corner as easily.\"\n\nSera whispered, \"I don't want you to leave because of me.\"\n\nMeilin snapped her gaze to her, softer than the words sounded. \"You're not the reason. You're the symptom. This is the disease.\"\n\nSera swallowed hard, eyes wet with shame and gratitude.\n\nMeredin continued, brisk. \"You need timing. You need a ship name. You need introductions that don't exist on paper.\"\n\nMeilin's mouth went dry. \"Luigi.\"\n\nMeredin's gaze sharpened. \"Luigi.\"\n\n---\n\nThe Happy Beholder wasn't happy because it was kind.\n\nIt was happy because it was profitable.\n\nLanternlight painted the tables in warm gold that lied about how sharp the world was. The air smelled of frying oil and sweet liquor and too many secrets pressed close together. Somewhere, someone laughed too loud. Somewhere, a deal got made with a handshake that wasn't a handshake at all.\n\nLarge Luigi hovered in his usual place like he owned the room by choosing not to touch it.\n\nHe didn't \"rise\" when Meilin approached. He simply drifted a little higher, as if granting himself a better angle, and let half a dozen eyes find her at once.\n\nOne eyestalk tracked her satchel. Another watched the door behind her. A third lingered on the nearest table's coin pile like it might confess something. The great central eye settled on Meilin's face with the calm, unnerving focus of a ledger being opened.\n\n\"You look like trouble,\" Luigi said.\n\nMeilin slid into the seat across from him. \"I look like business.\"\n\nLuigi's mouth curved. \"Same thing, usually.\"\n\nMeilin didn't waste time. \"My name is being traded.\"\n\nLuigi's expression didn't change, but three eyestalks tilted in tiny, synchronized adjustments, like he'd just checked his angles and found them satisfactory. Around him, the room subtly did what it always did: people leaned away without realizing why, as if giving space was a form of politeness to something that could see all the exits.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\nMeilin's fingers tapped once on the table, controlled. \"Who bought it?\"\n\nLuigi's glass rose from the table without a touch, held by an unseen pressure that looked effortless only because it was practiced. It made a slow, lazy circle, the liquor catching lanternlight as if the air itself were turning it.\n\nOne eyestalk drifted toward the bar (checking, not asking), then returned to Meilin like a hook drawing in line.\n\n\"Not one buyer,\" he said. \"It's being offered. That's the point. Somebody wants you *available*.\"\n\nMeilin felt the chill settle deeper.\n\nLuigi's central eye held hers while two smaller eyes watched the room with lazy vigilance.\n\n\"You want to know where the hook is.\"\n\n\"I want to know how to slip it,\" Meilin replied.\n\nLuigi drifted back a fraction, the way a predator re-centers its balance without ever looking away. \"You're not asking for protection,\" he observed. \"You're asking for timing.\"\n\nMeilin nodded. \"Meredin can make gaps. You can tell me which gaps won't get me killed.\"\n\nLuigi's smile went faintly impressed. \"That's almost polite.\"\n\nMeilin's eyes stayed flat. \"Don't get sentimental.\"\n\nLuigi laughed once, a short bark that sounded like amusement and warning. His eyestalks didn't join the laugh; they kept watching, as if humor was optional but surveillance was not.\n\nThe glass lowered itself back to the table. Then he spoke like a man reciting the weather.\n\n\"There's a cutter leaving in two nights. Captain owes me. Needs a medic. Doesn't ask questions if the coin clears. They'll take you on as ship's apothecary.\"\n\nMeilin's breath caught.\n\nOne eyestalk lifted, and two others angled toward the door in the same motion, as if illustrating the point with anatomy.\n\n\"But. Smith's Coster has friends. Dockside watchers. Customs clerks. If you walk down a gangplank with your name on your face, you'll never reach the deck.\"\n\nMeilin's jaw tightened. \"So what's the solution.\"\n\nLuigi's gaze flicked toward Meredin, who had not followed her into the Beholder but was present in Luigi's mind anyway, like a known weight.\n\n\"Introductions,\" Luigi said. \"And a different name for a day.\"\n\nMeilin's mouth twitched. \"I don't like lying.\"\n\nLuigi's smile sharpened. \"Then don't lie. Just… *omit.*\"\n\nMeilin's hands tightened in her lap. \"And Sera.\"\n\nLuigi's expression went still. \"Sera Quill?\" he asked, precise.\n\nMeilin's eyes narrowed. \"You know her.\"\n\nLuigi rotated one eyestalk in a small, dismissive arc. \"I know tidy clerks. They keep this place from collapsing under its own lies.\"\n\nMeilin leaned in. \"Keep her name out of it.\"\n\nLuigi's central eye met hers, unblinking, and for a moment the room felt colder, like every table had remembered it was being watched.\n\nThen he nodded once. \"Done,\" he said simply. \"You've been good for business. And you don't lie to me.\"\n\nMeilin exhaled slowly.\n\nLuigi continued, practical again. \"You leave in two nights. You don't go back to your shop the day of departure. Meredin will move you. Quiet. You show up at Dock Twelve at second bell with a satchel that looks like you're any other hired hand. You don't look back.\"\n\nMeilin swallowed. \"And if they stop me.\"\n\nLuigi's smile returned, thin as a blade. \"They won't stop you there,\" he said. \"Not if I'm the one who said you're stepping onto that ship.\"\n\nMeilin stared at him.\n\nTransactional trust. Clean, sharp, functional.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said, because she meant it.\n\nLuigi's glass rose again without a touch, hovering for a beat in a mock salute. \"Try not to die,\" he said. \"You're expensive to replace.\"\n\n---\n\nOn the night Meredin moved her, Bral felt like it was holding its breath.\n\nMeilin didn't go to the shop's front. She didn't say goodbye to the familiar corners. She didn't take one last look at her wall of marks, because nostalgia was a hook and she was already carrying too many.\n\nHer father met her in the back room, holding a small bundle wrapped in cloth.\n\nHe didn't ask if she was sure.\n\nHe didn't lecture.\n\nHe just placed the bundle in her hands.\n\nInside was his old notebook (the symptom book, worn at the edges, pages dense with the irritating habit of being right).\n\n\"You'll need this,\" he said.\n\nMeilin's throat tightened. \"You're staying.\"\n\nHer father's mouth twitched: sadness, pride, both kept under control. \"Someone has to keep the shop open,\" he said. \"If it closes, they win too easily.\"\n\nMeilin's fingers tightened around the bundle until the cloth creased. The weight of the notebook was familiar, but the moment wasn't. It felt like standing on a gangplank before it lifted. Still attached, already leaving.\n\n\"They'll come back,\" she said, voice low. \"They'll come when it's quiet. When you're alone.\"\n\nKaito didn't argue. He just met her eyes the way he always did when she tried to carry the whole dock on her spine. \"Then I'll be careful,\" he said. \"And I'll be boring. Boring survives.\"\n\nThat was his kind of love: not comfort, but instruction.\n\nMeilin nodded, the tears burning behind her eyes but refused entry.\n\nHer father cupped her cheek briefly (so quick it almost didn't happen). \"Remember,\" he said softly, \"you can't save everyone. Don't let that be the excuse they use to steer you.\"\n\nMeilin's voice came out rough. \"I'll save the ones I can reach.\"\n\nHer father nodded once, accepting the inevitability of who she was.\n\nMeredin watched from the doorway, gaze hard, approving in that unsentimental way.\n\nSera stood behind Meredin, half-hidden, clutching a small paper packet.\n\nShe stepped forward awkwardly and held it out.\n\n\"It's… nothing,\" Sera said, voice shaking. \"Just… I wrote down everything you asked. Where I bought things. When. Dates. Names. I don't know what matters, but…\"\n\nMeilin took it with careful hands.\n\n\"You didn't have to,\" Meilin said.\n\nSera's eyes shone. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"I did.\"\n\nMeilin glanced at the packet and saw Sera's handwriting through the paper in faint ridges: tidy pressure, controlled lines, the kind of work that kept systems standing. Sera had turned fear into documentation because that was the only weapon she knew how to hold.\n\n\"If anything happens,\" Sera said, and stopped, because saying the rest felt like inviting it. Her fingers tightened. \"If you have to show someone… show them the page. Not me.\"\n\nMeilin's expression didn't soften, but her voice did. \"I won't,\" she said. \"I'm not trading you for air.\"\n\nSera blinked hard, angry at her own tears. \"I don't want to be brave,\" she whispered. \"I just want to stop shaking.\"\n\n\"You did,\" Meilin said, and meant more than the words could carry. \"And you helped me find the disease.\"\n\nMeilin nodded once, and that nod contained a promise: *your name stays buried.*\n\nThen she turned away, because if she didn't turn away, she might not leave at all.\n\n---\n\nDock Twelve at second bell smelled like tar and cold air and the electric hush of spellwork settling into a helm.\n\nThe ship (smaller than the *Drift-Sparrow*, sleeker, built for speed and quiet passage) waited with its gangplank down like a tongue offered to the dark.\n\nMeilin approached with her satchel, cloth-wrapped vials silent, father's notebook heavy, and the ledger page hidden flat where it wouldn't crinkle or betray her.\n\nShe didn't look for watchers.\n\nShe assumed them.\n\nShe kept her face neutral, her steps measured, her hands steady.\n\nAt the foot of the gangplank, a man stood with a list and a lantern.\n\n\"Name?\" he asked, eyes scanning her.\n\nMeilin gave the name Luigi had arranged, half-true, enough to pass.\n\nThe man's gaze lingered, then slid away.\n\nHe nodded once. \"Welcome aboard,\" he said.\n\nMeilin stepped onto the ship.\n\nThe deck shifted under her, alive. The air tasted different: less like dock rot, more like possibility sharpened into danger.\n\nBehind her, Bral did not explode. It did not shout. It did not make a scene.\n\nIt simply became something she could no longer afford to stand still inside.\n\nAs the gangplank lifted and the helm's quiet hum deepened into readiness, Meilin placed a hand on the rail and felt the city recede like a fever breaking.\n\nShe had not taken to the void for adventure.\n\nShe had taken to the void because it was the only place left where her mind could keep moving faster than the cage.\n\nAnd because somewhere back on Bral, in a Smith's Coster ledger, there was a missing page.\n\nA gap.\n\nA warning.\n\nAnd now, out here between stars, that warning had a heartbeat.\n\nMeilin's."
