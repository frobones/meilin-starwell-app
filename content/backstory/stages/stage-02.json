    "**What happens**: Cassian leaves the Rock of Bral docks to \"see the stars\" and chase spelljamming helm work.",
    "**Why it matters**: Meilin learns that love can leave gently and still hurt; she starts collecting *proof* even in personal things (letters, dates, routes).",
    "**Ongoing hook**: Cassian writes occasionally from ports and passing ships, always upbeat, always light on details, always moving."

  "content": "Before Meilin learned to map sickness like a supply chain, the Starwell shop had another set of hands.\n\nCassian was older: old enough to reach the top shelf without a stool, old enough to lift a crate and pretend it was nothing, old enough to make the cramped apothecary corner feel like it had room to breathe. When Kaito was working with the calm intensity that made strangers obey, Cassian did the small, quiet things that kept the shop from collapsing: swept glass dust, tied bundles, carried deliveries with a runner's speed that didn't look like running.\n\nHe also talked about the stars like they were a door someone had forgotten to lock.\n\nNot in the heroic way sailors performed for coin, but in the way a hungry person talks about bread, plain, urgent, inevitable.\n\n\"Up there,\" he'd say, pointing at the dark between rigging lines. \"There's work that isn't decided by who knows your dockmaster. There's a helm. A real one. Imagine feeling a ship answer you.\"\n\nMeilin rolled her eyes the way younger siblings did when they were scared of wanting the same thing.\n\nCassian's dreams made Kaito quiet. Not angry. Not forbidding. Just quieter, as if he were weighing the cost of a life that moved faster than a dock could hold.\n\nThe offer that finally took Cassian away arrived sideways, like most dock offers. A sailor with soft hands. A job that wasn't called an apprenticeship but behaved like one. \"Helm-adjacent,\" they said, as if being adjacent to power was a harmless thing. They promised passage, training, and the chance to be useful enough that a helm-master might let him close.\n\nKaito asked questions with the same tone he used on fevers.\n\nWho pays.\nWho owns the ship.\nWhat happens if you say no halfway through.\n\nCassian answered as honestly as he could. Which meant: honestly about the hope, vaguely about the strings.\n\nThe morning he left, he tried to make it small. No dramatic goodbye. No dockside performance. A strap across his shoulder, a pack that didn't look heavy until you knew what it meant to carry a life on your back.\n\nMeilin woke to absence before she woke to sound.\n\nThe hook where his coat should have been.\nThe shelf he always put things back on was wrong now, because he wasn't there to correct it.\nThe way Kaito's hands paused over the mortar like the room had changed weight.\n\nCassian left a note that tried too hard to be cheerful.\n\n*I'll write. I'll send coin. I'll come back with the kind of proof you can hold.*\n\nMeilin kept it, of course.\n\nShe didn't keep it because she trusted promises.\nShe kept it because paper didn't change shape when people did.\n\nAfter Cassian, she started saving small things the way her father saved records: dates, marks, scraps, letters folded and refolded until the creases became permanent.\n\nEvery so often, a letter arrived from some port-name Meilin had never heard spoken out loud. The handwriting stayed the same, fast, a little too messy for someone claiming everything was fine. Cassian always sounded bright. He always said he was learning. He always dodged the questions that would have mattered most to Kaito.\n\nAnd he always ended the same way:\n\n*Tell Mei I'm looking up.*\n\nMeilin did not look up more often because of it.\nShe looked down: at the page, at the details, at the parts of the world that could be proven.\n\nBut she never threw the letters away."
