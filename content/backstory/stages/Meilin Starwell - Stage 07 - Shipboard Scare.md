# The First Shipboard Contamination Scare

## Key takeaways

- **What happens**: Meilin takes a short contract on the *Drift-Sparrow* and finds a “nothing” sickness with teeth.
- **Key relationships**: Captain **Rellan Thorne** hires her; Quartermaster **Tasmin “Cleanhands” Vale** becomes her ally/foil on inventory control.
- **What she learns**: Ship stores are life support: seals, seams, and handling are evidence; dinner is a diagnostic event.
- **Ongoing hook**: The contamination points to supply-side dosing (not superstition), sharpening her focus on distributors and lot marks.

Meilin didn’t take her first ship contract because she wanted the stars.

She took it because the docks had started feeling like a room with too many doors, and too many people learning which ones she used.

The offer came through Meredin the way most of Meredin’s offers did: not dressed up as rescue, not softened with sentiment.

“A ship needs a hand,” Nori said, standing in Meilin’s doorway like they belonged there. “Short contract. Clean pay. Quiet captain.”

Meilin didn’t look up from the counter where she was rewrapping vials in cloth to keep them from clinking. “Quiet captain is a contradiction.”

Nori’s mouth twitched. “This one’s more quiet than most.”

Meilin’s father, Kaito Starwell, was in the back, washing instruments. She could hear the steady rinse, the measured clink of metal.

“A ship,” Meilin said. “Why?”

Nori shrugged. “Crew’s been getting sick. They don’t want the clinics. They don’t want rumors. They want a person who solves problems and doesn’t write sermons about it.”

Meilin felt her father’s gaze without seeing it. The old warning, worn smooth: *Maps lead places.*

She set the last vial into her satchel. “Ship name?”

“The *Drift-Sparrow*,” Nori said. “Leaves on the next good window.”

Meilin paused. “And what does Meredin want?”

Nori’s expression was practical. “Meredin wants the crew not to die.”

Meilin swallowed the answer she wanted to give (*and me?*) because she already knew it.

The docks didn’t just make you useful. They made you accountable.

So she went.

---

The *Drift-Sparrow* didn’t look like the heroic silhouettes painted on tavern signs. It looked like work: patched planks, scuffed rails, an old spelljammer helm tucked under canvas as if modesty could make it less expensive. A ship built to survive more than to shine.

The first thing Meilin noticed wasn’t the rigging.

It was the smell.

Ships had a particular scent: tar, old wood, sweat, salt carried from a thousand ports. But under it was something wrong: a faint, sweet-stale note that didn’t belong to fresh supplies. Like grain that had breathed too long in a damp barrel. Like tea leaves that had been “improved.”

She stepped onto the gangplank and felt the deck sway under her, the way a body sways when it’s trying to keep secrets.

A sailor with a wide grin greeted her. “Apothecary! You’re the one who tastes poisons, right?”

Meilin didn’t slow. “I’m the one who makes sure you wake up tomorrow.”

He laughed like that was the same thing.

Captain Rellan Thorne met her near the helm, older, lean, eyes tired in the honest way. He gave his name once and didn’t linger on it, as if names were things that got caught in teeth.

“Starwell,” Thorne said. “You’ll have a bunk and a share. We’re not farbound, just a short run out and back, escort and resupply. Keep my people on their feet.”

Meilin glanced over the crew. She saw it immediately: pallor that wasn’t just lack of sunlight, hands that shook too much to be nerves, eyes ringed with the kind of fatigue sleep didn’t fix.

“How long?” she asked.

The captain’s jaw tightened. “Weeks.”

“What changed?” Meilin asked.

He hesitated. “Nothing.”

Meilin looked at him until “nothing” wilted.

Finally he said, “New supplier. Cheaper. Same stamps as always.”

Meilin’s fingers tightened on her satchel strap. “Show me your stores.”

The captain exhaled slowly, as if he’d been hoping she’d start with bandages instead. “Quartermaster handles inventory,” he said. “You’ll talk to Vale.”

---

Quartermaster Tasmin “Cleanhands” Vale met her outside the hold with a ring of keys and an expression like a locked door.

Vale was neat in a way the ship didn’t deserve. Sleeves rolled with precision. Hands clean despite the work. Hair tied back. Everything about them said *order is how we keep from dying*.

They looked Meilin up and down, their gaze flicking to the satchel, the cloth-wrapped vials, the ink-stained fingers.

“You’re the apothecary,” Vale said, tone neutral but edged. “Captain says you want access.”

“I want your stores,” Meilin replied.

Vale’s eyes narrowed a fraction. “That’s not how this works. If you need something, you request it. I log it. You receive it.”

Meilin gave a small, polite smile that meant nothing. “And if what you logged is what’s making your crew sick?”

Vale didn’t blink. “We keep clean inventory.”

Meilin lifted her hands slightly, palms out. “I’m not accusing you of filth. I’m saying something is wrong.”

Vale’s jaw set. “And you think the solution is to rummage through my hold like a dock rat?”

Meilin’s smile thinned. “I think the solution is to stop your crew from dying of ‘nothing.’”

That got Vale’s attention (not their emotions, but their brain). They hesitated, caught between principle and outcome.

Finally Vale turned the key. “You touch anything,” they said, “and I’ll know.”

Meilin stepped into the hold and breathed in.

Grain. Salt. Dried meat. Tea. Oil. The comforting skeleton of survival.

And underneath it (again), that faint wrong sweetness.

Meilin moved like she was in a clinic: slow, deliberate, respectful of the space. She didn’t tear into crates. She didn’t spill sacks. She ran her fingers along seams and listened to the subtle language of storage: dampness, residue, wax seals that had been re-melted.

Vale hovered a step behind her like a shadow with opinions.

“What are you doing?” Vale asked.

“Reading,” Meilin said.

“You can read with your fingers?”

Meilin didn’t answer. She picked up a sack of flour and tilted it, listening to the way it settled. Too clumpy. She sniffed near the seam, and caught the faint smell of something that wasn’t flour.

She set it down and pulled a small strip of wax paper from her satchel. Carefully, she scraped a trace from the seam and folded it away.

Vale’s voice sharpened. “That’s inventory.”

Meilin looked back. “That’s evidence.”

Vale stared at her. “We don’t do ‘evidence’ on a ship.”

Meilin’s eyes were cool. “Yes,” she said. “You do. You just call it ‘bad luck’ until it kills someone.”

Vale’s mouth tightened. “What do you want?”

Meilin gestured around them. “I want to know why half your crew looks like they’ve been bled slowly. And I want it in time to fix it.”

Vale’s shoulders rose and fell once (an effort of restraint). “Fine. You have one hour. Then you stop.”

Meilin nodded. “One hour is enough to find the lie.”

The sickness announced itself properly that night at dinner.

The galley was warm and cramped, lit by lanterns that made everyone’s faces look more tired than they were. The cook (a broad-shouldered woman with scars on her knuckles and pride in her eyes) served stew with the grim triumph of someone keeping people fed in a place where food was always one mistake from disaster.

A toast was raised. The captain said something brief. Someone laughed.

Meilin watched the bowl in front of her like it might speak.

She dipped a spoon, lifted it, and paused.

The cook’s eyes narrowed instantly. “Don’t start,” she warned.

Meilin didn’t look away. She sniffed once. Then again.

The cook’s pride flared. “It’s stew, not a ritual. Eat.”

Meilin’s voice was mild. “Who handled the salt?”

The table went quiet in the way it does when someone commits a social crime with a straight face.

The cook’s cheeks reddened. “What?”

Meilin looked around. “Who handled the salt.”

A sailor gave a nervous laugh. “Gods, she’s serious.”

Vale’s gaze cut toward Meilin like a knife. *Not now.*

Meilin didn’t flinch. “I’m not insulting you,” she said to the cook. “I’m trying to keep you from being blamed when this goes wrong.”

The cook slammed her ladle down. “It’s not going wrong.”

Right on cue, someone at the far end of the table coughed (wet, sharp) and then gagged as if their throat had decided to turn on them. Another sailor pressed a hand to their temple, eyes unfocusing, and whispered, “It’s happening again.”

The cook froze, pride collapsing into fear.

Meilin stood so fast her stool scraped. “Water,” she said, already moving. “Clean. Now.”

The captain barked orders. The galley erupted into controlled chaos.

Meilin knelt by the coughing sailor and took their wrist, feeling the pulse. Fast. Too fast. She lifted their chin, checked their mouth, eyes, skin.

“Any chest tightness?” she asked.

The sailor shook their head, coughing harder.

Meilin’s mind ran through routes. Not curse. Not wound. Not infection in this timing.

Exposure.

“Did it start after you ate?” she asked.

The sailor nodded.

Meilin looked up at the cook. “What changed tonight?”

The cook’s eyes were wide. “Nothing. Same as always.”

Meilin’s gaze flicked to the spice shelf, to a small tin near the back. It wasn’t the tin itself.

It was the way the lid sat.

Too tight, as if someone had reseated it with care.

Meilin crossed the galley in two steps, grabbed the tin, and cracked it open.

A sharp, bitter scent hit her: spice and something else riding underneath. Something fine, dusty, deliberate.

Vale appeared beside her, voice low and furious. “What are you doing.”

Meilin held the tin up. “This.”

Vale stared. “That’s pepper.”

Meilin tilted the tin so the lanternlight caught the powder. Most of it was pepper. But threaded through it (barely visible) was a paler dust that clung differently, like it belonged to a different grind.

“Pepper doesn’t separate like that,” Meilin said.

Vale’s face tightened. “You can’t know that.”

Meilin’s eyes were bright in a way that scared people who knew her. “I can,” she said softly. “Because I nearly died of ‘tea’ once.”

The cook whispered, “I didn’t… I swear…”

“I know,” Meilin said immediately, the same words she’d given Hask. “That’s why I’m not accusing you. I’m asking who had access.”

The cook swallowed. “Anyone. Everyone.”

Meilin’s mind clicked into place. Communal. Subtle. Deniable.

She didn’t announce it.

She simply set the tin down and did something that made three sailors flinch.

She dipped one finger into the powder and touched it to her tongue.

Vale grabbed her wrist. “Don’t…”

Meilin swallowed.

The taste hit: pepper bite, then a lingering bitter-metal note that blossomed in the back of her throat like a warning.

Meilin exhaled once, calm as a chart. “Mindersand,” she said.

Vale stared. “That’s…”

“A ‘drying powder.’ A ‘preservative.’ Whatever name makes it sound harmless,” Meilin cut in. “Not lethal for most. Not fast. Designed to make you shaky, fogged, compliant. Enough to ruin judgment. Enough to make a crew ‘accident-prone.’”

The captain stared at her. “Can you treat it?”

“Yes,” Meilin said. “If it stops now. If it doesn’t, it will stack. Dose on dose.”

Vale’s grip loosened. Their voice came out tight. “How long have we been eating this.”

Meilin looked at the tin. “Long enough that someone thinks you won’t notice.”

Vale’s eyes went distant (the ledger-mind running). “Supply,” they whispered. “This isn’t onboard.”

Meilin met their gaze. “No,” she agreed. “This is before you ever left port.”

For a heartbeat, the galley was silent except for the sick sailor breathing hard.

Then Vale straightened, anger sharpening into purpose. “Show me the sacks,” they said. “All of them. Right now.”

Meilin’s mouth twitched, an almost-smile, not of victory but of recognition.

This was how obsession was born: not from curiosity alone, but from necessity.

A ship didn’t have the luxury of pretending food was comfort.

Food was control. Water was control. The galley was a battlefield that refreshed itself three times a day.

That night, while the crew slept in uneasy pockets of exhaustion, Meilin and Vale stood in the hold under lanternlight and opened sack after sack like surgeons.

Vale’s hands stayed clean.

Meilin’s hands became ink-stained again as she marked lot symbols, compared stamps, traced which crates came from which vendor, which vendor came from which warehouse.

At some point, Vale spoke without looking up.

“You’re going to start taking things,” they said flatly. “Samples. Scrapes. ‘Responsible amounts.’”

Meilin didn’t deny it. “Yes.”

Vale’s jaw clenched. “If you steal from my inventory…”

Meilin finally looked at them. “If I save your crew,” she said, “you’ll call it theft. If I don’t, you’ll call it tragedy.”

Vale held her gaze a long moment, then looked away, defeated by the math of it.

“Log what you take,” Vale muttered.

Meilin blinked. “Excuse me?”

Vale’s voice was sour. “If you’re going to be unbearable, be unbearable with records. You take a pinch of flour, you write it down. You scrape a tin, you write it down. I won’t have you turning my hold into superstition.”

Meilin’s expression softened (not much, but enough to be human). “Agreed,” she said. “We’ll be unbearable professionally.”

Vale snorted once, almost a laugh, then shoved another sack toward her.

Meilin leaned in, sniffed, and felt the bitter-sweet wrongness again.

And in that moment, something in her clicked into its final shape:

The void wasn’t just a place to run.

It was a place where her methods mattered more than manners, because out here, subtle contamination didn’t just make people sick.

It made ships fail.

Crews die.

Routes end.

Meilin wrote down the lot symbol from the sack. She traced the stamp with her thumb. She looked at Vale and saw, for the first time, not a hostile gatekeeper, but a competent foil, the kind you could build a new kind of trust with: transactional, precise, and forged under pressure.

“This,” Meilin said quietly, tapping the symbol, “is where we start.”

Vale nodded, grim. “And when we dock,” they replied, “we find who sold it.”

Meilin’s eyes went bright again, the worrying kind.

“Yes,” she said.

Because now she had proof of the thing she’d suspected back on Bral:

The easiest way to control people wasn’t a blade.

It was what you fed them.
