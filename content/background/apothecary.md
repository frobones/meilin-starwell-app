# Apothecary

You learned the art of healing through herbs, tinctures, and practical medicine. Whether in a village clinic, a traveling caravan, or a bustling port, you've treated wounds, identified ailments, and mixed remedies from whatever plants and materials were available. You understand that medicine is as much about observation and patience as it is about knowledge. You've learned to read symptoms the way others read faces, and you know that the difference between a cure and a poison is often just a matter of dosage.
